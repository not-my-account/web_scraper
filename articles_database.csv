Six weeks ago, journalist Armando Linares choked up in a video announcing the killing of a colleague and promised to continue doing journalism that exposed the corrupt. Linares continued to publish the Monitor Michoacan online news site after the death of camera operator Roberto Toledo, writing stories about the monarch butterflies that winter in the mountains around Zitacuaro, butterfly-related festivities and other hyperlocal and state news -- occasionally including criticism of local officials.

On Jan. 31, the day Toledo was killed, Linares looked straight at the camera and said: ""There are names. We know where all of this comes from.""

""The Monitor Michoacan team has been suffering a series of death threats,"" he said. ""Exposing the corruption of corrupt governments, corrupt officials and politicians today has led to the death of one of our friends.""

Linares told reporters shortly afterward that he had continued receiving threats, that he had enrolled in the federal government's protection program for journalists and that he was receiving protection from the National Guard.

But on Tuesday evening, he was shot and killed at his Zitacuaro home. His body was found in the doorway, and he had gunshots in the chest, according to the state prosecutor's office. Authorities recovered 9mm shell casings at the scene.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, speaking at his daily news conference on Wednesday, said Linares had not accepted protection, raising the question of whether he had left the program at some point.

""Michoacan's journalists ask all public servants to save their condolences,"" reporter Rodolfo Montes said during the president's news conference. ""There is indignation ... there is fury, there is impotence at this wave of killings.""

Lopez Obrador repeated his promise that there would not be impunity in Linares' case and said there was no evidence that public servants were responsible. But at another point, the president continued his frequent attacks on the press, alleging ""lies"" and calling some ""mercenaries.""

In Michoacan's state legislature, dozens of journalists stood at the front of the chamber holding signs that read: ""Pacifist government doesn't kill journalists"" and ""Press. Don't shoot.""

A journalist group called ""Not one more Michoacan"" said in a statement that ""the calls to be alert and help from Armando where not listened to."" It also criticized the state and federal governments for disparaging the professionalism of Monitor Michoacan and downplaying the threats its staff faced.

The killings of journalists have been coming at a rate of nearly one per week this yearin Mexico. Advocates and the government have placed much of the blame on the high rate of impunity in killings of journalists and human rights defenders -- as well as other Mexicans.

Jan-Albert Hootsen, the representative in Mexico for the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists who had spoken with Linares after Toledo's killings, lamented his death.

""In a world where disinformation and manipulating every narrative is an objective brutally pursued by those with power and willing to use deadly violence, journalists are legitimate targets and impunity is the most powerful tool to silence them,"" he said.

Linares did not want Toledo's killing to go unpunished. In his video, he addressed his colleague's family: ""We aren't going to leave things like this. We are going to take them to their ultimate consequences.""

2,https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Mexican-journalist-killed-6-weeks-after-17006919.php,Mexican journalist killed 6 weeks after colleague murder,17/03/2022,United States,e56fb0c5-a64e-0805-711f-cd5a33ac0908,"ZITACUARO, Mexico (AP) — Six weeks ago, journalist Armando Linares choked up in a video announcing the killing of a colleague and promised to continue doing journalism that exposed the corrupt. Now Linares too has been gunned down — the eighth journalist killed in Mexico this year.

On Wednesday, his wife, children, siblings and friends prepared to see him off inside a small funeral parlor.

After initially halting his reporting for a few weeks and closing the Monitor Michoacan office following the killing of camera operator Roberto Toledo, Linares returned to reporting and resumed publishing the online news site.

He wrote stories about the monarch butterflies that winter in the mountains around Zitacuaro, butterfly-related festivities and other hyper-local and state news — but gone was the criticism of local officials he was known for before Toledo's killing.

Still, the threat for journalists had persisted, something Linares seemed to expect.

On Jan. 31, the day Toledo was killed, Linares looked straight at the camera and said, “There are names. We know where all of this comes from.”

“The Monitor Michoacan team has been suffering a series of death threats,” he said. “Exposing the corruption of corrupt governments, corrupt officials and politicians today has led to the death of one of our friends.”

Linares told The Associated Press shortly afterward that he had continued receiving threats, enrolled in the federal government’s protection program for journalists and was receiving protection from the National Guard.

“He never gave in to anyone,” said Liares' wife Rosa Elena Pedraza. “He died doing what he liked, he was a courageous man.”

She said Linares had government protection for a month after Toledo's killing, but said later it was lifted. “If everything is calm they take away the protection,” she said.

On Tuesday evening, Linares was shot and killed at his Zitacuaro home. His body was found in the doorway with gunshots to the chest, according to the state prosecutor's office. Authorities recovered 9mm shell casings at the scene. Authorities have not provided a suspected motive.

Magdalena Alonso, director of the news program Zitacuaro on the Air and a friend of Linares, said “for many motives it's easy for them to attack you ... because there isn't much security nor do authorities feel responsible for providing it.”

Illustrating that point, an unidentified man approached a group of journalists Wednesday afternoon gathered in the entrance to the funeral home. He showed them a pistol hidden inside his clothing and told them they had two minutes to leave.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, speaking at his daily news conference on Wednesday, said Linares had not accepted protection.

“Michoacan’s journalists ask all public servants to save their condolences,” reporter Rodolfo Montes said during the president’s news conference. “There is indignation ... there is fury, there is impotence at this wave of killings.”

López Obrador repeated his promise that there would not be impunity in Linares’ case and said there was no evidence public servants were responsible. But at another point, the president continued his frequent attacks on the press, alleging “lies” and calling some “mercenaries.”

In Michoacan’s state legislature, dozens of journalists stood at the front of the chamber holding signs that read: “Pacifist government doesn’t kill journalists” and “Press. Don’t shoot.”

A journalist group called “Not one more Michoacan” said in a statement that “the calls to be alert and help from Armando where not listened to.” It also criticized the state and federal governments for disparaging the professionalism of Monitor Michoacan and downplaying the threats its staff faced.

The killings of journalists have been coming at a rate of nearly one per week this year, an unprecedented spate of violence against the profession in Mexico. Advocates and the government have placed much of the blame on the high rate of impunity in killings of journalists and human rights defenders — as well as ordinary Mexicans.

Jan-Albert Hootsen, the representative in Mexico for the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists who had spoken with Linares after Toledo’s killings, lamented his death.

“In a world where disinformation and manipulating every narrative is an objective brutally pursued by those with power and willing to use deadly violence, journalists are legitimate targets and impunity is the most powerful tool to silence them,” he said via Twitter.

Interior Undersecretary Alejandro Encinas said Wednesday during a freedom of expression event at the Norwegian embassy that “if there is not prevention, if there is not investigation and there isn’t punishment, impunity will continue prevailing in these incidents.”

Linares did not want Toledo's killing to go unpunished. In his video, he addressed his colleague's family: “We aren't going to leave things like this. We are going to take them to their ultimate consequences.”

3,https://www.newdelhitimes.com/spanish-newspaper-criticizes-china-for-pressuring-reporters/,Spanish Newspaper Criticizes China for Pressuring Reporters - New Delhi Times - India Only International Newspaper,17/03/2022,United States,ef8a31c6-e574-1c56-680b-e0a182c71c74,"Tensions increased between one of Spain’s largest newspapers and China this month, when police in Beijing visited the home of one of the media outlet’s correspondents.

The Spanish daily ABC and its reporter Jaime Santirso both described the incident as “veiled intimidation.”

In a tweet thread on March 8, Santirso said that three members of the police visited his Beijing home on the eve of the National People’s Congress, the most important political event of the year in China.

Beijing has pushed back on ABC’s coverage in recent months, with its embassy in Madrid publicly condemning a series of articles and China’s Foreign Ministry late last year summoning the ABC bureau chief to complain about his reporting. Access to the ABC website has been blocked in China since last year.

Santirso and ABC declined to speak with VOA. But their experiences reflect the increasing challenges foreign media face in Beijing, according to media bodies, including the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China and the International Federation of Journalists, or IFJ.

The IFJ condemned the “wolf warrior diplomacy” employed by China toward Spanish journalists and said the country shows a well-known pattern of intimidation toward foreign media.

Taken from a film, “wolf warrior diplomacy” refers to a more aggressive approach adopted by some Chinese officials.

“The IFJ has documented a clear pattern of harassment or intimidation of journalists from countries that do not follow in step with China’s line, particularly on any sensitive topics. It is this type of intimidation that has forced other correspondents to leave their posts or relocate,” Jane Worthington, IFJ’s regional director, told VOA.

“Wolf warrior diplomacy and pressure from the state, combined with outright blocking like this, is part of a strategy to control the media narrative and attack foreign journalists’ independence,” Worthington added.

Santirso was not at home when the police visited. But on Twitter he said they spoke with his wife.

“Very kindly, they [the police] said that they wanted me to do balanced coverage of the [congress], with not only bad news but good news. A while later, they left,” Santirso said in a Twitter thread.

“This episode, a police raid in the private home of a journalist with the explicit purpose of influencing the tone and content of his work, is by no means a common practice and no other colleague has experienced something similar recently,” Santirso tweeted.

As a journalist and Beijing resident for eight years, Santirso said he has had several interactions with authorities and security forces over the years, “the vast majority of them have been cordial.”

“This in its way, was, too. At its heart, however, was a veiled intimidation!” he added.

Back in Spain, ABC responded to the incident in an editorial.

“This veiled intimidation, with the explicit intention to influence the tone and content of [Santirso’s] reporting, represents a worrying advance in the hostility toward international media by the Chinese government,” the editorial read.

It was not the first brush between the Spanish paper and the Chinese government.

In November, China’s Foreign Ministry summoned ABC bureau chief Pablo Diez. Officials wanted to correct some “errors” in a profile about President Xi Jinping.

Diez, who did not want to comment to VOA for this article, had described China in the piece as a “dictatorship.”

Around the same time, he wrote an article about tennis player Peng Shuai and other celebrities whom he said disappeared after falling out with or criticizing the Chinese government.

Peng disappeared from public after accusing Zhang Gaoli, China’s former vice-premier under Xi, of sexual assault in a November post to the social media platform Weibo. The post was taken down minutes later. Zhang did not publicly comment on the allegations.

In an interview with a French sports magazine in February, Peng denied saying anyone had assaulted her and said she removed the Weibo post herself.

The Chinese Embassy in Madrid published criticism of the ABC articles on its website, in which it named Diez, and said his articles were “full of ignorance, bias and lies.”

The embassy said that Diez’s reporting is “unscrupulously discrediting China and its leader, seriously violating the basic principles of journalism, such as objectivity and neutrality, and misleading the Spanish people about China.”

Shortly after the articles were published, access to ABC’s website was blocked in China.

VOA tried to contact the Chinese Embassy in Madrid for comment, but its calls went unanswered.

The Spanish Foreign Ministry is said to have complained to China’s embassy in Madrid and Foreign Ministry in Beijing about the criticism, sources familiar with the case told VOA.

Spain’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to VOA’s request for comment.

Chinese officials overseas are known to call journalists and media outlets to complain about coverage, media rights groups say.

A report by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China in 2021 also found that international journalists are facing “unprecedented hurdles” because of Beijing’s efforts to block and discredit independent reporting.”

“As the number of journalists forced out by the Chinese state grows due to excessive intimidation or outright expulsions, covering China is increasingly becoming an exercise in remote reporting,” the report said.

Journalists also are at risk of arrest. Haze Fan, a member of the Bloomberg News bureau in Beijing, has been detained since December 2020.

Chinese officials said at the time that Fan was detained by the Beijing National Security Bureau on suspicion of national security law violations.

“We are all very worried about her very well-being and we will continue to do everything we can to help her and her family,” John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said in a statement.

When Komlanvi Ketohou fled Togo in early 2021, he left behind his home, his family, and his cell phone that the gendarmerie seized when they arrested and detained him over a report published by his newspaper, L’Independant Express. In July, Ketohou, who goes by Carlos, learned that the phone number connected to the device they took may have been targeted for surveillance years before his arrest.

The revelation came via the Pegasus Project, a collaborative global media investigation detailing how thousands of leaked phone numbers, including many that belonged to journalists, were allegedly selected for potential surveillance by clients of the Israeli firm NSO Group. In addition to Ketohou, Togolese journalist Ferdinand Ayité, director of L’Alternative newspaper, was also on the Pegasus Project list, according to Forbidden Stories, one of the project’s partners. A third Togolese journalist, freelancer Luc Abaki, was similarly selected as a potential spyware target, according to a representative from Amnesty International, another of the project’s partners, who confirmed his number’s listing to Abaki and then to CPJ.

The use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware on these journalists’ phones has not been confirmed and NSO Group denied any connection to the list. But the three journalists told CPJ in multiple interviews conducted via email, phone, and messaging app that learning of their status as potential surveillance targets heightened their sense of insecurity, even as they continue to work in the profession.

“I spent nightmarish nights thinking about all my phone activities. My private life, my personal problems in the hands of strangers,” Ketohou said. “It’s scary. And it’s torture for me.”

The potential use of Pegasus spyware to surveil journalists in Togo adds to an already lengthy list of the country’s press freedom concerns. In recent years, journalists in Togo have been arrested and attacked, had their newspapers suspended over critical coverage, and struggled to work amid disrupted access to internet and messaging apps, CPJ has documented.

NSO Group has said it only sells its spyware, which allows the user to secretly monitor a target’s phone, to governments for use investigating crime and terrorism. Yet Pegasus has been repeatedly used to target members of civil society around the world, including Togolese clergy in 2019, according to Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto-based research group which investigates spyware. Over 300 Togolese numbers appeared on the Pegasus Project list of potential targets, Le Monde, another partner in the project, reported.

“I was very afraid,” Ketohou told CPJ after he said he was informed by Forbidden Stories that his number was listed in 2017 and 2018. He said it confirmed his decision to go into exile, where he started a new news site, L’Express International, after Togo’s media regulator barred L’Independant Express from publishing in early 2021 as CPJ documented. He asked CPJ not to disclose his location for security reasons.

Ketohou told CPJ that he couldn’t point to a specific article that may have triggered potential surveillance, but said that at the time his phone was selected his newspaper was reporting on nationwide protests—which began in 2017—opposing President Faure Gnassingbé’s rule. His position at the time as president of the Togolese Press Patronage, a local media owners association, and membership in the Togolese League for Human Rights (LTDH) advocacy group may have contributed to interests in having his phone monitored, Ketohou added.

L’Alternative director Ayité told CPJ that he was not certain what caused his phone number to be selected in 2018, as Forbidden Stories informed him, but that year his newspaper published what he described as “sensitive” reports on the political crisis surrounding the protests and the mediation efforts by surrounding countries.

He said the selection of his number for potential surveillance fit a pattern of Togolese authorities’ efforts to intimidate him and L’Alternative.

In February, CPJ documented how Togo’s media regulator for the second time in less than a year suspended L’Alternative; Ayité told CPJ in late July that the suspension ended in June. In a separate incident, in November 2020 a local court ordered Ayité and L’Alternative each to pay 2 million Western African francs (US$3,703) in damages to a Togo official who complained that their reporting on his alleged embezzlement violated the country’s press code; Ayité told CPJ that he has appealed the court order and that the next hearing is scheduled to be held on October 10.

Unlike the other two journalists, Abaki said he was taking a break from journalism in 2018, the year he was listed for potential targeting, according to the Amnesty International representative.

But Abaki, who has been freelancing since last year, has also had his journalism impeded by authorities. In 2017, Togo’s media regulator closed La Chaîne du Futur and City FM, the television and radio stations he directed at the time, over alleged administrative issues, according to the government of Togo’s website. Abaki told CPJ that the closure was a political reprisal against a local politician who owned the station.

CPJ’s questions to Togo’s Broadcast and Communications High Authority, sent via the contact page on its website, as well as by text message to its president, Willybrond Télou Pitalounani, went unanswered.

Abaki said that being listed for surveillance was “extremely traumatic,” adding “there is no private life.”

“I told myself that I could have died, since the other journalists targeted from the other countries were murdered,” Ketohou told CPJ.

The Guardian reported that around the time Saudi Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018, phones belonging to his associates and family, including his wife and fiancée, were targeted with Pegasus spyware. Separately, The Guardian also reported that freelance Mexican journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto was selected for surveillance with the spyware a month before his assassination in 2017. Spyware attacks often occur alongside other press freedom violations, CPJ has found.

“There is a huge psychological impact of knowing that someone in this country is taking control of your phone, violating your privacy,” Ayité told CPJ, adding that his broader safety and privacy concerns had already caused him to limit his dating and other personal relationships. “I will be even more careful and vigilant you never know where the fatal blow will come from. I am a journalist on borrowed time.”

CPJ’s calls to Akodah Ayewouadan, Togo’s minister of communication and spokesperson for the government, rang unanswered. In July, President Gnassingbé said he “can’t confirm” the use of Pegasus spyware to target his political opponents, according to Le Monde. “Each sovereign state is organizing itself to face what threatens it with the means at its disposal,” he said.

In an email to CPJ, NSO Group said that “NSO will thoroughly investigate any credible proof of misuse of its technologies” and “will shut down the system where necessary.” NSO did not directly respond to CPJ’s questions about the mental health implications of its technology’s sale and use.

Meanwhile, Ketohou has vowed to plow ahead with his journalistic work. “I have increased security around me, my internet activities, my work,” he said. But the experience, he added, “did not deter or intimidate me in my work as a journalist or human rights defender.”"

(MOSCOW) — Marina Ovsyannikova, the woman who crashed Russia’s state news broadcast Monday night to protest the war, was fined 30 thousand roubles, or around $280, and released on Tuesday.

Ovsyannikova ran onto the set of Russia’s main state news broadcast with an anti-war sign. She stood behind the anchor on the Channel One show with a sign that said “Stop the war” and “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here,” in English and Russian.

Ovsyannikova worked as an editor for Channel One, according to Russian human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov, who said he is now representing her.

Ovsyannikova appeared in a court in Moscow after her lawyers said they had been unable to locate her since she disappeared at the TV station.

“These were really difficult days in my life. I spent two days without sleep. The interrogation lasted more than 14 hours. I was not allowed to contact my friends and relatives. I was not provided with any legal assistance,” Ovsyannikova told reporters outside the courthouse. “I will give more comments tomorrow. Today I want to rest.”

Ovsyannikova is charged with an “administrative offense,” essentially a misdemeanor, that carries a fine but not a jail sentence, according to a reporter from the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.

In English, Ovsyannikova answered a question outside the courtroom and said it wasn’t a surprise she was released since she has two children. Russian law means that, in general, mothers with dependent children should not be placed in detention for minor offenses.

Chikov wrote on Twitter that Ovsyannikova was detained after the protest and taken to a police station in Moscow. He said she has been charged with “discrediting the Russian Armed Forces.”

Novaya Gazeta said the court has told it Ovsyannikova is charged under Part 2 Article 20.2 — “organizing unauthorized public events” — which means she would face at most 15 days in jail and a fine.

She is not charged under Russia’s new “fake news” law that carries up to 15 years prison for spreading “false” information about Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Ovsyannikova also published a video online before her protest in which she explained her motivations for protesting. She said she has worked for the last few years for Channel One and that she is now “very ashamed” of working for “Kremlin propaganda.”

“I am ashamed that I allowed lies to be spoken from the TV screen. I am ashamed that I allowed the zombification of Russian people. Now ten generations of our descendants won’t wash off the disgrace of this fratricidal war. We’re Russian people, thinking, intelligent. It’s only in our power to stop this insanity,” she said.

6,https://www.cjr.org/analysis/afghanistan-journalists-taliban.php,What happened to Afghanistan journalists after the government collapsed,17/03/2022,United States,0ee85573-f175-abfe-2772-6a3692740677,"After the government in Afghanistan fell last year, the darkness was rapidly closing in.

Hundreds of journalists were forced to leave Afghanistan. Many are in hiding, hoping to do the same. Some have tailored their content to ensure they stay on the right side of strict Taliban media guidelines—issued after the group promised to honor a free press. Others who stood defiant have been beaten by threats and violence.

Waliullah Rahmani fears that recent history is being repeated and Afghanistan is once more becoming an invisible, ungoverned space where terrorists thrive and jihadism threatens the security of the world.

“It is inevitable,” Rahmani said from his own place of safety in northern Europe. “You will see the situation of the 1990s repeated. International terrorist organizations will come to Afghanistan, and because there is no one to see them, they will operate freely. And then, if not another 9/11, then something—a big, big threat to international security will, for sure, take place.”

Farshad Fattahi was an investigative reporter in the western city of Herat with independent ASR Television. In late July he went to Kabul for research. While he was away, the Taliban took control of Herat and closed down the station.

He lives in a secret location in the capital, with no money and no income, afraid for his life as the work that was once his living is now his liability. He hasn’t been back to Herat, or seen his family, since he left. “I am very afraid that my identity will be revealed, and if this happens it will mean big trouble for me,” Fattahi said.

Fattahi is just one of the hundreds who have been unable to find a way out of Afghanistan and to safety; vulnerable people like Fattahi are trapped, aware of the consequences of being found by the Taliban.

Almost as soon as they took control, the Taliban began detaining and beating journalists; at least two were beaten so badly after being detained while covering an anti-Taliban protest by women in September that one has lost part of his hearing and eyesight.

Last fall, media regulations were issued, aimed at ensuring the only news fit to print is that which suits the Taliban. News organizations must coordinate with the Taliban, curtailing critical independent reporting.

Human Rights Watch described the new regulations as so vague and sweeping that journalists are self-censoring for fear of falling foul of the Taliban and ending up in prison.

The Taliban’s return came almost twenty years to the day after the United States invaded Afghanistan, on October 7, 2001, and ended their five-year regime in retaliation for giving sanctuary to Al Qaeda while the 9/11 attacks were planned and carried out.

During that time, the Western alliance poured in billions of dollars to create a modern, democratic state. The United States alone invested $1 billion in building media and communications, and was largely paid back with a vibrant sector of dedicated, world-class professionals.

It was a source of pride—a bright light shining on a corrupt polity and poorly managed international military and aid efforts. Hundreds of millions of dollars disappeared into the pockets of politicians, businesspeople, community leaders, and aid administrators. Afghanistan’s journalists played their role in holding them to account. Many reporters, broadcasters, photographers, and camera operators were killed.

In recent years, that independence was challenged by the president, Ashraf Ghani, who fled Afghanistan on August 15, clearing the way for the Taliban. He held media in contempt and followed the lead of Donald Trump in branding criticism of him or his administration “fake news” to undermine public trust in journalism.

Even before the Taliban’s return to power, eleven journalists had been killed in Afghanistan in 2021, including Danish Siddiqui, a Pulitzer-winning Indian photographer with Reuters, who was embedded with Afghan Special Forces near the Pakistan border on July 16.

According to unesco, eighty journalists have been killed in Afghanistan since 2005; the worst year was 2018, when nine journalists covering a suicide attack were killed by a second bomb aimed directly at media.

The Taliban campaign against journalists picked up in 2020, after they signed a bilateral deal with Trump that pledged a US military drawdown, to zero, by May 1 of 2021. The deal bypassed and undermined Ghani’s government, transforming the insurgents into a legitimate political entity. They declared victory over the Western alliance and ignored the conditions of the deal that applied to them, including cutting ties with Al Qaeda.

Instead, their brutality against Afghan civilians and military intensified, and journalists became specific targets, along with politicians and government officials, human and women’s rights advocates, judges, police, and military leaders.

Of the media outlets still operational on August 15, “70 percent have disappeared,” Rahmani said. “This is natural, because the Taliban have never been tolerant of media; they censor; they don’t allow any narrative but their own.”

Journalists were among the thousands evacuated in the chaotic international airlift that followed the August 15 Taliban takeover, according to Najib Sharifi, head of the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee. By his own rough estimate, in the weeks following the collapse of the republic, around two hundred journalists had left the country and, he said at the time, “at least another three hundred need to get out.” They are spread all over the country, he said, though “journalists in the provinces are much more under threat” now that independent reporting has become a thing of the past.

International media-support organizations have largely failed to provide the help that Afghanistan’s journalists have needed in a time of extreme distress.

Many who do arrive in Western capitals find that the support they are offered can come with strings attached—conditional, for instance, on applying for asylum and being sucked into the maw of the global refugee bureaucracy, often not permitted to work while their applications are processed, which can take years.

Reporters Without Borders, for instance, was able only to provide journalists with “basic information about the asylum process, and explain [to] them which organizations will be able to support them during the asylum process,” according to Victoria Lavenue, the organization’s head of assistance in Paris.

This presupposed that journalists wished to give up their professional status and enter the refugee bureaucracy, effectively becoming wards of the state, unable to work or live independently, often for years, while their applications for resettlement were processed.

More than a hundred journalists from Afghanistan issued an open letter via Reporters Without Borders begging international organizations to pressure the Taliban to embrace freedom of speech and free media. Their call goes unheeded.

As the new regime’s intentions unfurled, Afghanistan’s media owners adopted differing tactics for survival, some loudly holding on to their journalistic principles, others morphing into what one former news executive called the “Taliban’s propaganda platforms.”

Rahmani—who was already living under extreme threat when the republic fell—went into hiding immediately after the Taliban entered Kabul. His website, Kharbanama, and Reporterly, a daily subscription roundup of significant news on Afghanistan, went silent until Rahmani reemerged in late September in northern Europe. He rebranded and relaunched the newsletter as Brevity. Now he needs to find his way to an English-speaking country where he can continue working—and avoid the asylum trap.

It’s a different story for ToloNews, owned by the Moby Group, which was established in 2003 and funded largely by American taxpayers, with startup money from the US Agency for International Development. It pioneered 24-hour TV news, as well as entertainment programming. Its owner, Saad Mohseni, has been compared to Rupert Murdoch—and attended the Australian mogul’s recent star-studded birthday party.

Immediately after the Taliban entered the capital, Tolo management tried to preempt their clampdown and ordered women presenters to, first, stay at home and then, when they were allowed back to work, to alter their dress to appear more conservative, as Farid Ahmad, the station’s former deputy operations director, wrote in an article for Newsweek.

Former Tolo journalists said they were directly threatened by the Taliban. Some spent weeks working, eating and sleeping in their offices in the Moby compound in central Kabul as Taliban gunmen repeatedly visited their homes, searching for them by name.

Many Tolo employees were evacuated from Kabul immediately after the capital fell. They are now scattered around the world, in Pakistan, Qatar, Mexico, Turkey, and Albania, waiting for resettlement. Many received an email from Tolo immediately after they left Afghanistan terminating their employment. Many said they have not received their August salary. Many more are desperate to leave.

While Tolo’s owners had made an obvious effort to stay on the right side of the Taliban—even while requesting funding from the State Department to relocate operations outside Afghanistan—one crusading daily newspaper tried to stick to its journalistic principles. Etilaatroz made its reputation revealing the filthy underbelly of Afghanistan’s powerful and connected. In the days after August 15, when anti-Taliban protests erupted in major cities, its coverage was as hard-hitting as usual, with editors and journalists alike vowing that their mission to uphold freedom of speech would not be compromised.

And then, on September 8, video journalist Nemat Naqdi and photojournalist Taqi Daryabi drew global attention for the injuries they sustained under Taliban torture. They were detained while covering a women’s rights demonstration in Kabul and held for two days. Publisher and editor Zaki Daryabi—Taqi’s brother—said Naqdi has lost 40 percent of the sight in one eye and needs surgery to repair a burst eardrum.

Zaki Daryabi, who won Transparency International’s Anti-Corruption 2020 award, said that Etilaatroz now publishes just a few news stories a day, having decided that the hard-hitting investigations into official graft that made its reputation would risk further violent reaction from the Taliban.

Zaki left Afghanistan in mid-October, forced to flee his homeland, he said, in fear for his life “under threat from the Taliban.”

A Russian journalist was forced to flee the country after officials made public threats against her.

Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, called her a “terrorist” and demanded her arrest.

Investigative reporter Elena Milashina said in a February 4 interview that she’s aware “that the danger is high.”

An official in the Chechen region of Russia called investigative reporter Elena Milashina a “terrorist” and made public threats against her. Concerned for her safety, the Russian journalist was forced to flee the country in search of refuge.

Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, demanded that Milashina and Igor Kalyapin, head of the Committee Against Torture, be arrested adding that Chechen authorities “always destroy terrorists,” according to a Telegram post in late January.

He also accused Milashina, who reports on human rights abuses in Chechnya, of “making money off the subject of the Chechen Republic and the Chechens.”

“I take all these threats really, of course, seriously, I understand that the danger is high,” Milashina said in a February 4 interview.

At least five reporters at the independent newspaper where Milashina works, Novaya Gazeta, have been killed since 1992. Kadyrov had also denounced the publication and another independent outlet, Dozhd TV, in his post.

Milashina had previously been forced to flee Russia for other coverage including reporting on the gay purge in Chechnya in 2017 and again in 2020.

In another instance, Milashina, alongside a human rights lawyer named Marina Dubrovina, was assaulted in the Chechen capital, Grozny, last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

The committee urged Russian authorities to guarantee Milashina’s safety back in February.

“We call on federal authorities in Russia to take threats made by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov against journalist Elena Milashina seriously and hold him and other Chechen officials accountable,” CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, in New York Gulnoza Said in a February 8 statement.

“Milashina, Novaya Gazeta, and Dozhd TV do the crucial work of shedding light on Chechnya, and should not be hindered, let alone threatened. Russian authorities must ensure Milashina’s safe return.”"

China accused of torturing jailed Tibetan monk

CCP critic Go Sherab Gyatso is serving 10 years after being convicted of instigating separatism

By UCA News reporter Updated: March 14, 2022 07:41 AM GMT

China’s communist regime has come under fire from human rights activists for the alleged torture of a jailed Tibetan Buddhist monk that has led to a grave deterioration in his health.

Go Sherab Gyatso, 45, a prominent monk, religious philosopher and author known for his strong criticism of the repressive policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has remained in Qushui prison in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China, since November last year.

The monk was jailed for 10 years on charges of instigating separatism and inciting subversion of state power. He has been subjected to various forms of torture and ill-treatment in the prison ever since, Bitter Winter reported on March 11.

Rights activists have condemned the “inhuman” treatment of a human rights defender and political prisoner.

Rights Protection Network, a group monitoring rights violations in China, issued a statement on March 7 to express their grievances over the torture of the monk and called for his release.

In February, New York-based Human Rights Watch issued a statement deploring the detention and abusive treatment of the monk and called for his immediate release from “wrongful imprisonment.”

""Once again the Chinese government’s wrongful imprisonment of a Tibetan risks becoming a death sentence”

It said the monk has been suffering from a chronic lung condition, which has worsened in jail as he might not be receiving adequate medical treatment.

""Once again the Chinese government’s wrongful imprisonment of a Tibetan risks becoming a death sentence,” said Sophine Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “Go Sherab Gyatso should be immediately released and given comprehensive medical care.”

Go Sherab Gyatso was born Sept. 9, 1976, in Khashi village in Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province in southwest China, which has a significant concentration of Tibetan people.

He became a monk in Sichuan and moved to Lhasa for Buddhist studies. He authored several books on Tibetan Buddhism and became a lecturer on Tibetan Buddhism in Sichuan and other provinces. He became known as one of the most prominent Tibetan Buddhist philosophers of his time.

However, he fell out with the CCP for refusing to accept repressive religious policies and the attempted imposition of strict political indoctrination imposed on Buddhist monks in Sichuan, according to Bitter Winter.

He was first arrested in 1998 in Sichuan and jailed for three and a half years. Due to torture and abuses in the prison, the monk contracted chronic lung disease.

The monk was arrested for the second time in 2008 amid a heavy crackdown on Tibetan monks and activists by the Chinese regime to prevent potential protests during the Beijing Olympics. He was released after one year in prison.

“The Chinese authorities’ determination to systematically silence Tibetan scholars is clear evidence that their aim is to devastate Tibetan culture, language and religion”

He was arrested for the third time in 2011 for his articles and books that criticized the CCP’s repressive policies. He was released from prison in 2013.

Gyatso was detained in October 2020 but his whereabouts remained unknown for months. In response to a letter by UN Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances in 2021, the Chinese government said he was arrested on charges of separatism.

Human Rights Watch said it was seriously concerned about the condition of the imprisoned monk as the group has recorded the deaths of three Tibetan monks in prison since October 2020 and a host of Tibetan political prisoners since 2018.

“The Chinese authorities’ determination to systematically silence Tibetan scholars is clear evidence that their aim is to devastate Tibetan culture, language and religion,” HRW’s Richardson said.

Tibet, a region of rugged terrain with an estimated population of three million, was annexed by China in 1951. The region’s ethno-cultural Tibetans have long struggled for independence only to be brutally suppressed by Chinese authorities.

China denies freedom of speech, religious and political association in Tibet, fearing that allowing freedom might lead to ethnic separatism and a strong independence movement.

In protest at China’s draconian repression of Tibet, at least 157 Tibetan monks, nuns and laypeople have self-immolated in Tibet and other parts of China since 2009.

MOGADISHU, Somalia — Somali Journalists Syndicate (SJS) and the Somali Media Association (SOMA) condemn the restrictions and blocking of independent media and journalists seeking to observe and report on the process of the indirect elections in Somalia; and express serious concern at the repression and threats against journalists dealing with allegations of irregularities, harassment of candidates and looting of seats in Mogadishu and in the federal Member States.

Journalists in Mogadishu, Hirshabelle, the South West, Jubbaland, Puntland and Galmudugu have faced systematic restrictions as they have been denied access to information related to the electoral process, monitoring of polling stations and also investigating profiles of candidates running for parliamentary positions.

Electoral authorities in Mogadishu and regional states have used security forces, including National Intelligence and Security Agency officers, federal and regional police officers, as well as election staff, to prevent journalists from covering the election campaigns of opposition candidates and allegations of delegate-buying and malpractices including phony contestants, barring access and right to contest of certain candidates.

Jubbaland

In Jubbaland, intelligence officers attached to the office of president Ahmed Mohamed Islam (Madobe) summoned 13 journalists on 20 December and instructed to keep off any coverage related to election dispute and complaints. A senior Jubbaland intelligence officer called ‘Basaam’ had threatened journalists with harsh consequences should they report complaints about the results of election of the Lower House seats in the state. On 28 December, a group of journalists covering the election of Lower House seats in Kismayo’s Daawad hall were threatened with arrest and beating and their camera equipment taken to prevent the journalists’ independent coverage that day.

Repression and intimidation led journalists in Kismayo to resort to self-censorship for fear of possible detention, torture or even death. SJS and SOMA documented five cases of journalists, some of whom fled Kismayo, while others chose to refrain from reporting election-related issues or reports that could irritate the Jubbaland authorities.

Hirshabelle

In Hirshabelle, on 31 January, police officers in Jowhar, under the command of Police Commissioner Hassan Dhi’isow, called by phone and threatened Tusmo TV reporter Abdirahman Shamcun after the journalist posted a video on his Facebook containing the complaints by Shiidle elders of the Bantu minority community. Shiidle elders complained that the selection of their two seats had been mishandled accusing Hirshabelle president Ali Abdullahi Hussein (Gudlawe) of embezzling the delegate selection process. According to the journalist, On the same day Hirshabelle police spokesman Diini Roble called reporter Shamcun and asked about his whereabouts and an hour later NISA and police raided the journalist’s headquarters in Jowhar. However, the journalist fled after his family advised him to leave.

Beledweyne journalists have been denied access, despite the state’s indirect election team’s commitment to accredit journalists. Reporters in the city were stopped and harassed on 20 February as the voting of a parliamentary contested by the former NISA commander Fahad Yasin took place in the city. Local reporters reported that they were blocked from the hall when they approached as roads in the city were closed that day with most traffic blocked and public movement restricted by the Gorgor and Haramcad forces. A rival candidate who protested about the election process was prevented from speaking to the media, although one Mogadishu-based media outlet later broadcasted the protester’s speech.

Mogadishu

In Mogadishu, independent media outlets and their journalists were not allowed to cover the proceedings of the Lower House election for the Somaliland clans in Mogadishu from late January to February. Journalists said that although they had been given entry cards during the Upper House elections, they were informed by the electoral staff that reporters could not come to the Hangar inside Mogadishu Airport where the voting took place. NISA officers and police locked the venue to prevent journalists from entering the hall. Journalists cited the fact that the process was murky and some legitimate candidates were not allowed to contest as the reason to block independent media.

South West State

In South West State, Journalists have given up their intention to cover Lower House election in the regional state as in November due to the pressure, repression and intimidation from South West officials. The intimidation came into effect in late October 2021 when police at Baidoa Airport targeted and detained eight local media journalists who were at the airport to report an election campaign by an opposition contender. On 16 February, NISA officers entered a hotel in Baidoa where an opposition parliamentary candidate was holding a press conference and ordered journalists out of the hotel by threatening to beat and arrest them.

Journalists said the parliamentary election process in South West was largely run by relatives and family members of Southwestern President Abdiaziz Hassan Mohamed (Laftagaren) and had weaponised security forces to threaten journalists and block independent media access to election stations or places where clan delegates met.

In Barawe, on 17 February, South West State Parliament Speaker Ali Said Faqi, had instructed NISA officers in Barawe and his personal bodyguards to arrest journalist Osman Aweys Bahar who works for the community-owned Radio Barawe. That was a day after the journalist published a video interview of Mr. Faqi. The interview which journalist Bahar conducted contained critical questions on Mr. Faqi’s (now MP-elect) role in “the malpractice of the electoral process in South West and blocking rival candidates”. On 24 February, a police officer informed journalist Bahar that a case against him was brought at the Barawe police station by unnamed officials.

Puntland

Puntland officials held the Lower House elections inside at military bases in Garowe and Bossaso. Journalists said live television coverage has been barred, with a small number of journalists getting access to the 54th Division military camp in Garowe. Opposition figures were not permissible to be interviewed. In Bosaso, the base of the Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) was used as another polling station, to which local journalists did not have access.

Galmudug

In Galmudug, NISA officers blocked independent journalists from covering the voting process in Dhusamareb. Journalists’ access was blocked in particularly on 14 February during the election of Abdullahi Kulane, an ex-NISA officer, and on 25 November during the election of the current acting NISA commander, Yasin Farey. Journalists in Dhusamareb had been instructed not to interview candidates complaining against the anomalies of the process. Journalists said NISA officers loyal to Abdullahi Kulane and Yasin Farey approached reporters and ordered them to leave as they interviewed female candidates who protested against the malpractice that took place in Dhusamareb.

“The Somali leaders failed to uphold their commitment to allow journalists to observe and report on the electoral process. Journalists across the country have been denied access, threatened and some even forced to flee their hometowns. Now the question is about the legitimacy of a parliament and a government formed out of this murky process where journalists were threatened and independent coverage blocked,” Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, the Secretary General of Somali Journalists Syndicate (SJS) said.

“We condemn the restrictions, intimidations and threats subjected to the Somali media community across the country. We demand accountability on those who involved in these violations and provision of access to journalists and media coverage to inform the citizens,” Mohamed Osman Makaran, the Secretary General of Somali Media Association (SOMA) said.

(New York) – Taliban authorities have carried out far-reaching censorship and violence against Afghan media in district and provincial centers, drastically limiting critical reporting in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said today. The situation facing journalists outside Kabul appears much worse than inside the capital, particularly for women.

Journalists in the provinces have described Taliban members threatening, detaining, and beating them and their colleagues who were trying to report the news. Many journalists have felt compelled to self-censor and report only Taliban statements and official events. Women journalists have faced the most intense repression.

“Taliban harassment and attacks on journalists outside major urban areas have largely gone unreported, causing media outlets in outlying provinces to self-censor or close altogether,” said Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “In many provinces, the Taliban have virtually eliminated reporting on a wide range of issues and have driven women journalists out of the profession.”

On February 2, 2022, the Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, told a meeting of the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee, a media advocacy group, that journalists should consider “national interests, Islamic values, and national unity” before publishing. He said that a new media commission would be established to address any problems, and that the authorities would enforce the former government’s media law. He also said without elaborating that “women can work freely in the media by observing Islamic and national principles.”

But journalists throughout Afghanistan have said that the Taliban severely restrict their work in violation of the Afghan media law and international human rights standards on freedom of expression and the media. An estimated 80 percent of women journalists across Afghanistan have lost their jobs or left the profession since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, and hundreds of media outlets have closed.

Human Rights Watch spoke with 24 journalists and other media workers in 17 of the country’s 34 provinces to learn about conditions outside of Kabul. Journalists in each of these provinces said the Taliban actively monitor their publications and compel them to share the content of their reports with the provincial Directorate of Information and Culture before publication. Many of the journalists said that Taliban intelligence officials regularly meet with media organizations to tell them what to publish and to warn them not to contradict Taliban policies or to report on acts of violence by Taliban officials.

“We all fear for our safety,” a reporter in Baghlan said. “If something happens to a journalist, there is no institution or system to support them, or to seek justice. There is no support for the media workers in Afghanistan right now.”

Many journalists said they or their colleagues had been beaten for trying to report on anti-Taliban protests, arbitrary detention, rising food prices, and other subjects that cast Taliban officials in a bad light. In some provinces, Taliban officials told all women journalists to stop working. The few who are allowed to work can no longer have roles in which they come face-to-face with the public.

“Getting the news from Afghanistan’s rural areas has never been easy, but the Taliban’s repression of the media in the provinces is dangerous both for the journalists and the people whose lives are harmed by unreported abuses,” Abbasi said. “Governments should press the Taliban to end to all attacks on the media, whether in Kabul or the countryside.”

For detailed findings, please see below.

Repression of Provincial Media Under the Taliban

Since November 2021, Human Rights Watch has conducted interviews remotely, using secure communications, with 24 journalists and other media professionals currently working in Badakhshan, Badghis, Baghlan, Balkh, Daikundi, Ghor, Helmand, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Kapisa, Kunduz, Nangarhar, Paktia, Parwan, Takhar, and Uruzgan provinces. Interviews were conducted in Dari and Pashto with the informed consent of the interviewee. The names of the interviewees and specific location information has been withheld to protect their safety.

Detentions and Beatings

Many of the journalists interviewed said that Taliban officials had harassed, beaten, and arbitrarily detained them or their colleagues, in some cases holding them for hours or days. Some had been beaten for reporting on unauthorized anti-Taliban protests, which the Taliban have banned, as well as any news coverage of unauthorized protests. A female journalist in Balkh said that, in September, Taliban soldiers had beaten her on the street while she was trying to cover women’s protests. She said: “Journalists can easily get beaten by Taliban soldiers in the streets and no one will be held responsible. In the past few months, the journalist from Arezo TV has been beaten and a Pajhwak journalist in Balkh has been arrested.”

A journalist in Kandahar said that, in December, Taliban members beat him while he was on the street preparing a report on the rise in food prices. That month, the Taliban detained two journalists and badly beat them in custody. One was released after a few hours, the other after six days. Their colleague said that both have remained under surveillance.

An editor working outside of Kabul said that, in December, one of his journalists went to the passport office to report on the difficulties Afghans were having obtaining passports. A member of the Taliban police badly beat him and confiscated his camera. The editor said the reporter was beaten even though he had permission from officials in Kabul to cover the issue.

Reporting Taliban abuses or intervening on behalf of journalists also carries risks, and journalists said that Taliban officials have warned them against critical reporting. A journalist in Badakhshan said that, after he wrote a report about a commander who had beaten a resident, a Taliban official ordered him not to publish it and said that “this should be the last time that [he] even dares to think of reporting on such issues.” A journalist in Kandahar said that he witnessed Taliban members beating another journalist but that, “when we went to the police station, they told us to never come there for these issues.”

Taliban officials do not provide information on detentions, and journalists fear the consequences if they report on such Taliban abuses. On November 25, a Taliban unit detained Nawid Azami, a resident of Lashkar Gah, Helmand, after he posted a comment on Facebook calling for teachers to be paid their salaries. On November 28, his body was found with marks of torture. While a report of the incident was published outside Afghanistan, no local media covered the story. A Helmand journalist said, “No one dared to report it.” Journalists in other provinces expressed the same apprehension. “The atmosphere is full of fear,” one said. “No one reports Taliban violations.”

In Herat, a journalist who works for a radio program that invites the audience to call in and talk about their everyday lives or problems, such as food prices, said: “We make sure that they do not complain about the Taliban. Otherwise, we will be questioned.”

Women in the Provincial Media

The Taliban’s media restrictions have been particularly devastating for women journalists outside the capital, who typically have had to fight even harder than their urban counterparts to establish their careers in media in the face of sexism and security risks. Since the Taliban takeover, most women working in media have lost their jobs. and in some provinces, there are no longer any women journalists.

In Ghor province, the Taliban’s Cultural Affairs Department, which regulates the media, has turned away former women journalists when they came to their jobs, saying they have no orders confirming that female journalists can work. As of February, there were no female journalists in Ghor. In Kapisa, a journalist said that in the first days of the Taliban takeover, officials said that women journalists should stay home, and there has been no change since then.

A former journalist in Helmand said that she had six female colleagues, but as of February there were no female journalists working in the province. She said that Taliban officials have instructed the media not to involve any women as program hosts or guests. Cultural programs in which women had been involved have also been terminated.

In Nangarhar, women’s media programs have also been closed down, and no women are allowed in newsrooms. One journalist who was still employed said she was only allowed to work from home. “I cannot appear in any audio or video program, and I can only publish my reports on the online website,” she said.

A female journalist in Herat said: “I work in a radio station, and since the Taliban have come to power, I have not been allowed to be present [in the newsroom] – I only work in the background. I have been told that my voice can't be broadcast.”

A journalist who worked in Kandahar and Zabul provinces said that the Taliban prohibit the media from reporting on the ban on secondary schools for girls. “I have been threatened and warned not to report on any issues of concern to women,” she said. “Previously there were female journalists in Kandahar and Zabul, but now there are none.” According to a journalist in Kandahar, when the Taliban closed the Mirman (woman) radio station in Kandahar, 50 employees – most of them women – lost their jobs.

A journalist in Balkh said, “Women even cannot even attend seminars and events held by the journalists themselves.”

Censoring Reports; Limiting Access to Information

Since the Taliban takeover, ministry officials have prohibited the media from broadcasting many programs, including almost all entertainment programs. The media are also unable to report on a range of subjects, including anything to do with opium production, military and police actions, protests, and anything else the Taliban authorities deem too critical. Even reports that had been published before the Taliban takeover are subject to scrutiny. Media officials in Kandahar said they had to remove a report on opium from their website.

Before producing any news article or report, journalists are required to seek permission from the provincial Cultural Affairs Department. After drafting the document, they must submit it for review. Nothing can be published without the department’s approval. Journalists in several provinces said that this process can substantially delay publication. In Takhar province, journalists said that cultural affairs officials often pass their proposals to the Intelligence Department, which then must grant permission before they can proceed.

A journalist in Parwan said: “We coordinate all our activities with the authorities. They edit and filter our reports, and then we publish them.” A former investigative reporter in Paktia said, “I haven’t been able to make a proper report since their takeover. Now I cover only very basic issues. They told us that we should stop thinking that the previous government is still in power and that we can report as before.”

Taliban officials have said the media must follow “Islamic and national principles,” but journalists said that the guidelines are vague. “There isn’t a clear understanding of what ‘Islamic values’ mean, and we don’t know how to interpret it, which leads to self-censorship,” a journalist in Baghlan said.

Some Taliban officials have required the media to report on corruption in the previous government. “They have also told us that if we want to work on these issues, they will help us,” a journalist from Ghor said. “The information they give to us is not completely accurate as they edit it according to their wishes.” Journalists from several provinces said that Taliban officials call and tell them to report on official events, and they feel they must for their own safety. The Taliban have also created online chat groups with the journalists, and issue instructions for them there.

One of the most sensitive issues for the Taliban is their ongoing conflict with the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), an affiliate of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). A reporter from Kandahar said that, after his outlet filed a report on an ISKP attack, they “received phone calls from the Taliban spokesperson telling us to stop working on these reports – we are not allowed to broadcast such news.” The media in several provinces have been prohibited from reporting on aid distributions and the humanitarian crisis. “These are very sensitive issues, and no one can touch them,” a journalist said.

The Taliban have banned entertainment programs, social programs, and political programs. The media in Badghis province reported that, after the Taliban takeover, music on radio and TV disappeared, even advertisements were not allowed to play background music. There are also limits on the programs the media can broadcast. A journalist in Kapisa said, “there are no longer any political shows or live programs; these have been replaced with more Islamic programs.” He also said that entertainment programs had completely stopped broadcasting. “Two days ago, one of our technical colleagues mistakenly broadcast two songs, and Taliban contacted us to say this must be the last time [that happens].”

Access to information is very limited in Afghanistan, and journalists have also been detained and punished when they have tried to obtain information for their reports. Reporters in some provinces say they need written permission from officials to travel to other districts. “When an incident happens, it is our responsibility to go to the scene, take pictures, record videos, and talk to witnesses, but we are no longer allowed to,” a Badakhshan journalist said. A journalist from Helmand said, “You cannot ask relevant departments to give you more information, only the Directorate of Cultural Affairs can be contacted.” As a result, “only 10 percent of incidents are being reported, the rest remains untouched.”"

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet made the comments a day after British police announced the first overseas arrest over war crimes allegations in Sri Lanka.

The island nation had drifted towards “militarisation” under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a retired army lieutenant colonel, and the rights situation was deteriorating, Bachelet said.

“In the last two years, the independence of the judiciary… and other key institutions have been eroded, and democratic space, including for human rights advocacy constricted,” she said.

In a report to be unveiled at the UN Human Rights Council sessions reviewing Sri Lanka’s record next week, she also noted that the state had dropped investigations into emblematic cases.

“There has been a further drift towards militarisation,” she said, accusing Colombo of protecting military officers facing allegations and even giving them high positions in the administration.

She urged UN Human Rights Council member states to invoke universal jurisdiction and prosecute Sri Lankan officials facing credible allegations of war crimes.

Successive Sri Lankan governments have promised but failed to investigate their own troops accused of killing thousands of Tamil civilians in the final months of the island’s decades-long Tamil separatist war.

The fighting ended in May 2009 following a no-holds-barred military offensive that crushed minority Tamil guerrillas known for their suicide bombings.

Bachelet asked member states to “explore the possibility of targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators of grave human rights violations and abuses” in Sri Lanka.

The appeal came a day after the arrest of a suspect by British war crimes police over a 2000 murder of a high-profile journalist in Sri Lanka’s northern Tamil heartland of Jaffna, where much of the fighting was concentrated.

London’s Metropolitan Police war crimes team on Thursday announced the arrest of a 48-year-old man in Northamptonshire in connection with the murder of Tamil reporter Mylvaganam Nimalrajan.

British police can investigate anyone who may fall under British jurisdiction and is suspected of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide or torture anywhere in the world under a “no safe haven” policy.

Sri Lankan authorities fear the arrest of the as-yet-unnamed suspect could set a precedent for the detention of current military officers or government officials.

Jayanath Colombage, the top civil servant at the foreign ministry, told reporters in Colombo — before an advance draft of Bachelet’s report was released — that the British move could have implications for current office-holders.

“Invoking universal jurisdiction is another very debatable topic,” he said.

“Any country can use this as an excuse to target people of another country,” he added, calling it a “very big danger”.

On February 21, 2018, at exactly 8:21pm, Slovakia changed forever.

Ján Kuciak, a young investigative reporter, and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, were drinking coffee in their home in the small Slovak village of Velká Mača when a man knocked on their front door wielding a 9mmn Luger.

Within seconds, both were shot dead: Ján crumpled on the basement stairs, Martina in the kitchen.

The two were murdered at the unbearably young age of 27. Their deaths — widely connected with Ján’s work to expose corruption — inspired the biggest protests in Slovakia since the fall of communism.

The ruling party fell, but that was just the first domino. Evidence secured in the murder probe led to new investigations. In the past four years, thirteen judges have been charged with obstruction of justice and corruption. One police president committed suicide, a second is under investigation, and a third — the one who initially oversaw the murder case — has been charged with heading an organized criminal group.

But the arrests do not mean that all is well. A special court trying Ján and Martina’s murder found the lead suspects — including Marian Kočner, the notorious businessman accused of masterminding the crime — not guilty due to lack of evidence. And none of the arrested judges or police officials have gone to trial, let alone been sentenced. Voices from the reform movement are conflicted on how to move forward: Though Slovakia’s politics have changed, the country’s new leaders have not fulfilled the people’s hopes. The ugly face of the old system, many say, is trying to stage a comeback.

“The murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová brought hope to Slovak society,” says sociologist Michal Vašečka. “It existed for two years. But the new prime minister and the COVID situation flushed the hope down the sewer.”

“We Never Chose This”

In 2018, in the weeks and months after the murder of their children, the Kuciak and Kušnírova families were asked by organizers of anti-corruption demonstrations to speak out. Their challenge was not only to mourn, but also to gather the courage to speak in front of tens of thousands of people.

“We never chose this,” Ján’s father Jozef said.

“I never would have done it. But I felt I had for Martina, my daughter,” recalls Zlata Kušnírova. “So I went to the protests and talked to the huge crowds. I cried so much I couldn’t even read my prepared words, so I just spoke from my heart.”

The families received letters of support, but were also targeted by strange acts of hatred.

Someone repeatedly vandalized the flowers laid on Martina’s grave.

“It drove me crazy,” her mother said. “So I put a sign on the doors of a local shop, ‘If you want to talk to me, let’s please talk. If you don’t have flowers, I will buy you some. And if you need a vase, I’ll lend you one of mine. Please leave Martina’s grave untouched, she never did anything bad to you!’”

“Once, I received a letter that my son was a CIA agent. It was anonymous,” said Jozef Kuciak. “I tore it to pieces and threw it away. It was bullshit.”

The Kuciak family lives in a small village in the hills of northwest Slovakia. When reporters visited their home in 2018, the garden was covered in snow. Behind the front door sat two big boxes of candles.

“Every day I visit the grave of my son,” said Ján’s mother Jana, pointing to the candles. “It’s four kilometers there and back. If there is no one to take me by car, I walk or ride a bike. I must go there every day, no matter what.”

Since that first visit, the house has been remodeled. In the corner, where there used to be a wooden stove, hangs a small memorial with photos of Martina, Ján, and the journalism awards he posthumously received.

Finding the Killers

Initially, neither family believed that their child’s murder would be properly investigated.

Nor did Peter Juhás, the young policeman appointed to lead the investigation. “It was obvious from the crime scene that the assassination was committed by a professional,” he said. “We thought it could be a professional killer from abroad, no longer in Slovakia.”

But in Spring 2018, Juhás got the feeling they were close to a homegrown culprit.

“I can recall the moment, probably in March or April, when I told one of the lawyers: ‘my intuition says we’re on the right path, and we can really move forward in the upcoming months.’”

He was right. In September 2018, police raided several houses in a small town in southern Slovakia. Eight people were detained, three of whom were later charged with planning and carrying out the assassination. One of them, who acted as the middleman, cooperated with the police and explained how it was done. Most importantly, he mentioned the name of Marian Kočner, a businessman connected to the country’s ruling party, who was later charged with ordering the killing.

Ján had written extensively about Kočner, earning public disdain from the famously ill-tempered oligarch. In a combative phone call, Kočner even threatened to dig up dirt on the young reporter and his family. Police would later find surveillance photos of Ján and his fiance on a USB key in the oligarch’s house and connect him to the killers through text messages.

The murder trial began in January 2020. Both the middleplan and the shooter confessed and received reduced sentences of 25 and 15 years respectively. Kočner, his confidant Alena Zsuzsová, and the hitman’s driver Tomas Szabo pleaded innocent. The final verdict was read in a crowded courtroom in early September 2020. The judge found the driver guilty, but acquitted Kočner and Zsuzsová of the murder charges due to lack of evidence. The victims’ families left the courtroom in tears before the judge even finished reading his decision.

The acquittals incited outrage among a public that hoped justice had returned to Slovakia.

Prosecutors and legal representatives of the families filed an appeal. In 2021, the Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court to reevaluate the evidence.

In the meantime, Kočner was sentenced to 19 years in prison for a different financial fraud involving the forgery of promissory notes – a case that was launched by Ján’s reporting. And Alena Zsuzsová was sentenced to 21 years for her involvement in another assassination in 2010.

Their new trial for the murders of Ján and Martina will begin this spring. It will likely be merged with other charges Kočner and Zsuzsová are facing: an alleged 2018 plot, never carried out, to murder two prosecutors and a lawyer.

“According to what I know from the case file, my assassination was only in the early stage of planning,” said that lawyer, Daniel Lipšic, who was elected the head of the special prosecutors’ office in 2021. “It was postponed because it was considered risky. Then the order for Ján Kuciak’s assassination came, which was a priority for Kočner.”

If the murder cases are merged, they are expected to become much stronger, and Kočner will be likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.

A Lucky Break and a Reckoning

While searching Kočner’s properties, police collected laptops, USB sticks and even guns. But what they didn’t find was his phone. Lead murder investigator Júhas recalls an earlier missed opportunity: “In the forged promissory note case, I contacted the investigator and asked about the phone,” he said. “He told me Kočner’s lawyer took it. So we narrowly missed the chance.”

But in the end, investigators got lucky, obtaining not only one but two of Kočner’s phones. While in pretrial detention for a different fraud, Kočner entrusted a confidant with not only his phones, but also their access codes. In the end, the confidant decided to give him up, and handed these phones over to the police.

Fortunately for investigators, they contained years of messages from an encryption application called Threema that Kočner used to discuss sensitive matters with a wide range of people including judges, prosecutors, oligarchs and law enforcement intermediaries. Since investigators had the physical phones and access codes, the encryption made no difference.

By Dave Gahary —

The obvious assassination of an Argentinian prosecutor bent on proving the Islamic Republic of Iran’s responsibility in the 1994 bombing on the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires was clearly the work of Israel’s national intelligence agency, Mossad. Over the past two decades it has been shown that the attack, the deadliest bombing ever in Argentina, was the work of the Zionists, who were embroiled in a bitter political fight in Israel after the olive branch of peace was offered to the Palestinians by Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.

The bombing of the Jewish Community Center, which killed 85 Jews and injured several hundred others, was the supposed work of a suicide bomber, and was immediately blamed on Iranian terrorists, although the alleged vehicle was never found and no evidence of Iran’s involvement was ever found. Significantly, Iran has a very large Jewish population who are not subjected to any discrimination due to their faith. Israel, however, has a long history of murdering anyone they see fit, including Jews and Americans, in false flag terrorist attacks for political causes, the most notable being the 1954 Lavon Affair—a failed series of bombings carried out by Egyptian Jews recruited by Israeli intelligence and designed to be blamed on Egyptian Muslims.

The prosecutor, 51-year-old Natalio Alberto Nisman, was a Zionist Jew and the chief investigator of the 1994 bombing. On January 19, Nisman was found dead at his home in Buenos Aires the day before he was set to present evidence of his inquiry of the bombing to Argentina’s congress. He was found by his mother in a pool of blood next to a .22 caliber handgun dead from a single shot to his head. The gun belonged to his assistant who had lent it to him. Paraffin tests showed no gunshot residue on Nisman’s hands and there were no signs of a struggle. Nisman knew he had information that would create a stir, telling a reporter on January 14 that “I could be dead by the end of this.”







Historians have shown that only hardline elements in Israel profited from the AMIA bombing. On July 1, 1994, Prime Minister Rabin allowed Yasser Arafat to return to Palestine from exile. Just two weeks later, the AMIA building was bombed. A few months later Rabin was assassinated in Israel by Yigal Amir—a radical right-wing Jew—punishment for Rabin’s dovish Labour Party policies. Amir was a member of the fanatical settlers’ movement, connected to Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security department, which Rabin was trying to rein in.

Those knowledgeable with the 1994 bombing suspect that Nisman may have uncovered evidence of Israeli involvement in the operation, which would need to be suppressed.

Ralph Schoenman, author of The Hidden History of Zionism, points to the 2013 “memorandum of understanding” Argentina signed with Iran, establishing a “truth commission” to investigate the AMIA bombing.

The fact that Argentina demanded a new investigation involving Iran as a co-investigator with the Argentinean authorities themselves “makes clear that within Argentina the realization has become quite substantial that this event has vanishingly little to do with Iran and everything to do with an intrigue that requires looking elsewhere,” said Schoenman.

“The apprehension of the Israeli authorities is well founded,” said Schoenman, “because that’s where the finger will be pointed when the evidence is in.”









With around 250,000 in the country, about .5% of the population, Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America."

Three staffers from TOLO TV were taken from the station on Thursday evening, according to Khpalwak Sapai, head of TOLONews department and one of the arrested. Sapai later said that he and Nafay Khaleeq, the station's legal adviser, were released within hours later Thursday.

Journalist Bahram Aman, a news presenter, was kept in custody overnight and released on Friday evening, the station said.

Moby Group, the media company that owns TOLO TV, said the detentions were the result of the station reporting “about the banning of the foreign drama series” — a decision made by the Taliban-appointed Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.

The Taliban gave no explanation for their ban, the latest restriction imposed since their takeover of the country in mid-August.

TOLO TV is an Afghan-owned media company with interests in South and Central Asia as well as the Middle East and Africa.

The United Nations and the Committee to Protect Journalists decried the arrests and demanded the Taliban stop harassing Afghan journalists and stifling free expression through threats, arrests and intimidation.

“The Taliban must immediately ... stop detaining and intimidating members of the Afghanistan press corps,” a statement from CPJ said.

The U.N. mission in Afghanistan expressed “its deep concern about the detentions of journalists and the ever increasing restrictions being placed on media in Afghanistan.” The mission, known as UNAMA, said on Twitter: “Time for the Taliban to stop gagging & banning. Time for a constructive dialogue with the Afghan media community.”

The Taliban did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Since sweeping back to power last August, the Taliban have sent erratic signals about what the media landscape will look like under their rule, with international journalists sometimes welcomed and Afghan media often attacked.

The ranks of journalists in Afghanistan thinned dramatically during the chaotic days of the U.S. withdrawal last August when tens of thousands of Afghans fled or were evacuated by foreign governments and organizations. Many who stayed, and even those who have not had run-ins with the new Taliban rulers, say they are afraid of what tomorrow might bring.

The majority of TOLONews reporters and producers are women. Sapai, the station's executive, said he had made a special effort to recruit and train Afghan women journalists.

In December, Reporters Without Borders and the Afghan Independent Journalist Association said that 231 out of 543 media outlets had closed, while more than 6,400 journalists lost their jobs after the Taliban takeover. The outlets closed for lack of funds or because journalists had left the country, according to the report."

The Taliban arrested three journalists from TOLO TV Thursday night, according to the Afghan television station.

The three employees were detained after airing a story about the Taliban's censorship of a foreign drama series in Afghanistan.

TOLOnews head Khpalwak Sapai and colleague Nafay Khaleeq, the legal adviser to TOLO TV, were released hours after their arrest. Station presenter Bahram Aman remains in custody as of Friday.

Aman told the TOLOnews team on a phone call Friday that the Taliban have promised to release him after two meetings.

Officials from the Taliban's General Directorate of Intelligence took the three employees into custody after nightfall on orders from the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which was recently extended for another year, condemned the Taliban's suppression of journalism.

""UNAMA expresses its deep concern about the detentions of journalists and the ever increasing restrictions being placed on media in Afghanistan,"" the mission wrote. ""Time for the Taliban to stop gagging & banning. Time for a constructive dialogue with the Afghan media community.""

The Washington, D.C.-based Committee to Protect Journalists released a similar statement, calling on the Taliban to ""immediately release TOLOnews journalist Bahram Aman, and stop its intelligence agency from arbitrarily arresting and intimidating media personnel.""

It continued: ""Afghanistan's once thriving independent media community cannot operate effectively under constant Taliban threats and harassment.""

The Taliban took over the Afghan government shortly after U.S. troops began exiting the country last year, a move that raised concerns globally about human rights in Afghanistan."

Kabul, Afghanistan — Taliban intelligence men arrested three staff members of TOLO TV, one of Afghanistan's largest television stations, a channel executive said Friday.

The country's new rulers apparently didn't like a story the broadcaster aired on their decision to ban foreign drama series from local television, said Khpalwak Sapai, head of TOLONews, who was among the three arrested.

One of Aman's relatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP, ""Our whole family is concerned. Previously... they had threatened him.""

The intelligence officials from the Taliban's General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) came shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday to arrest the three. Sapai said the station was still seeking Aman's release.

The arrests were met with international outcry, including broader demands from the U.N. and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) for the country's rulers to stop harassing local journalists and stifling free expression through threats, arrests and intimidation.

The deaths provide a glimpse at what Saudi justice looks like now that MBS has been emboldened by Western governments that have failed to hold him accountable for the killing of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as numerous other crimes and abuses.

Since he became crown prince, MBS has consolidated power by attacking any source of influence that could check his authority.

The Interior Ministry announced that the government had executed 81 men who were “convicted of terrorism,” among other capital offenses, claiming that some of these men were operatives of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State terrorist group. Of course, the regime provided scant evidence to substantiate these claims and carried out these killings while world leaders were preoccupied with Ukraine. The killings were likely announced publicly to demonstrate the government’s power and reinforce a climate of fear among the Saudi people.

While the execution was the country’s largest to date, it follows mass executions of 37 people in 2019 and 47 people in 2016. Despite the incendiary rhetoric that the government used to justify these executions, many charges didn’t merit the death penalty under Saudi law and often didn’t even merit arrest. Some of the charges were for acts as uncontroversial as attending peaceful demonstrations.

Saudi officials completed the mass execution privately, and, according to people close to the victims, the government refused to deliver the bodies to the families. That the government wouldn’t allow aggrieved families to bury their loved ones speaks volumes about the absolute power and fear with which MBS intends to rule the country when he becomes king. MBS’s path to the throne is all but assured since he has eliminated actual and potential rivals within his own family, and his rule could begin very soon, because his 86-year-old father has suffered illnesses.

Since he became crown prince, MBS has consolidated power by attacking any source of influence that could check his authority. Beyond Khashoggi’s death, this has included the detainment, torture and coerced transfer of wealth of nearly 400 powerful Saudi business leaders, former government officials and members of the royal family.

There have also been unjust arrests, detainments and the forced disappearances of moderate Saudi clerics who dared to call for even modest legal reform. One of us, Abdullah, faces continued harassment from Saudi officials, even in the U.S. Abdullah’s father has been imprisoned since 2017 in solitary confinement and faces possible execution for calling for peace on Twitter. Nineteen other family members have been banned from leaving Saudi Arabia.

The damage from the executions this week won’t be limited to those in Saudi Arabia, however. Instead, they could further destabilize the region and inflame tensions with Iran, as 41 of the men who were executed are believed to have been members of Saudi Arabia’s minority Shia community. While it is an oversimplification to equate Shia Muslims with Iran, the country did suspend key diplomatic talks with Saudi Arabia the day after the executions. Long the subjects of state persecution, Shias live predominantly in Saudi Arabia’s oil-rich but underdeveloped Eastern Province and remain second-class citizens within the country despite MBS’s promised reforms.

The Saudi government reportedly tried the Shia men in its Specialized Criminal Court pursuant to the country’s counterterrorism law, like the rest of those who were executed. The United Nations and human rights advocates have widely criticized this law as being politicized and lacking in fundamental due process rights.

It didn’t have to be this way. When the Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence issued its report on Khashoggi’s murder, concluding that MBS likely ordered the operation, U.S. officials and responsible world leaders had all the evidence they needed to hold him to account. Instead, they did nothing.

U.S. officials should have sanctioned MBS like they did the 17 killers and operatives whom he is assessed to have ordered to murder Khashoggi and dispose of his body. They should have included him in their ban on 76 other Saudis connected to the killing and prevented from traveling to the U.S. At the very least, the U.S. government should now stop selling the Saudi government billions in U.S. weapons and military equipment that allow MBS to continue his reckless and unwinnable military intervention in Yemen, where the U.N. and human rights investigators have concluded that some Saudi actions likely amount to war crimes.

Now, faced with another appalling human rights violation by Saudi Arabia, the State Department declined to comment on whether it even raised the matter with the Saudi government, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken is planning a possible trip to Riyadh to implore the kingdom to produce more oil rather than stick to its deal with Russia to limit oil production. So much for President Joe Biden’s promise to make the Saudi government “the pariah that they are.”

As terrifying and reckless as MBS has been as the crown prince, he could be even worse as the king. Western leaders who decided to embolden and not sanction him have themselves to blame."

Ugandan author and activist Norman Tumuhimbise and a female journalist have been charged with cyber-stalking the country's president, their lawyer told AFP Thursday, the second writer to be arrested by the authorities recently.

Tumuhimbise, who heads local pressure group The Alternative Movement and an online media platform Alternative Digitalk TV, was due to launch a book critical of President Yoweri Museveni on March 30.

The 36-year-old was among nine journalists arrested for offensive communication a week ago. Seven were released without being charged, his lawyer Eron Kiiza said.

""Norman Tumuhimbise and his colleague, Farida Bikobere, who works with him at Digitalk TV, were charged with cyber-stalking the president,"" Kiiza told AFP.

Following Wednesday's hearing, ""The two denied the charges and were remanded to Luzira prison until March 21,"" he said, referring to a maximum-security facility in the capital Kampala.

""Both were tortured like the other journalists with whom they were arrested.""

According to court documents seen by AFP, prosecutors allege Tumuhimbise and Bikobere used their online platform to relay ""offensive communication... directed against the person of the President of Uganda"".

Tumuhimbise and his colleagues were reportedly bundled into a van by armed security personnel last week, with Kiiza alleging that police also confiscated phones, laptops, recorders and cameras from the media outlet.

Tumuhimbise is the second writer to be charged with offensive communication in recent months.

Award-winning Ugandan author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija fled to Germany last month to seek medical treatment after allegedly having been tortured following his detention on charges of insulting Museveni and his son.

Rukirabashaija's arrest had raised international concern, with both the European Union and the United States calling for his release.

The charges against Rukirabashaija related to unflattering comments on Twitter about Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, and his powerful son Muhoozi Kainerugaba.

In one post he described Kainerugaba, a general who many Ugandans believe is positioning himself to take over from his 77-year-old father, as ""obese"" and a ""curmudgeon"".

Uganda has witnessed a series of crackdowns aimed at stamping out dissent, with journalists attacked, lawyers jailed, election monitors prosecuted and opposition leaders violently muzzled.

If convicted, Tumuhimbise and Bikobere risk a year in jail and/or a fine, under the computer misuse act."

New York, March 15, 2022 – In response to news reports that a court in Zimbabwe on Tuesday declined to dismiss the 2021 immigration case against New York Times freelance correspondent Jeffrey Moyo, the Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following statement expressing disappointment:

“We are disappointed that more than nine months after his arrest, and after 21 days in detention and countless hours in court, journalist Jeffrey Moyo was not acquitted of the spurious charges relating to his work with his colleagues at The New York Times,” said Angela Quintal, CPJ’s Africa program coordinator. “The decision to deny the defense’s application to dismiss the case is doubly troubling as Moyo’s co-accused was acquitted in a separate trial last week and simply reinforces perceptions that the case is being used to intimidate the independent press in Zimbabwe.”

Authorities arrested Moyo in the capital Harare, alongside Zimbabwe Media Commission registrar Thabang Manhika on May 26, 2021, and accused them of contravening Section 36 of the Immigration Act by producing fake media accreditation cards for two foreign New York Times journalists, Christina Goldbaum and Joao Silva, who were deported after three days in the country, as CPJ documented at the time. Manhika was acquitted in a separate trial on March 10, 2022, according to news reports.

The defense applied to have the case dismissed after prosecutors closed the state’s case against Moyo last month, arguing the state had been aware it had no case since at least June 2021 when, in reply to Moyo’s bail application on appeal, it said in court documents that its case against the journalist was on “shaky ground,” according to the discharge application, which CPJ reviewed, and the journalist’s lawyer Doug Coltart, who spoke to CPJ by messaging app.

Today, a Bulawayo magistrate ruled that the prosecution had sufficient evidence against Moyo to put the accused to his defense, Coltart told CPJ via messaging app. The trial will continue April 28 and Moyo faces at least 10 years in prison if convicted under the Immigration Act."

The police made the allegations in a dossier prepared to justify Shah’s detention under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act. Shah was booked under the Act on March 14.

The Public Safety Act allows the authorities to hold individuals in custody without trial for up to two years to prevent them from acting in any manner that is prejudicial to “the security of the state or the maintenance of the public order”.

Police in the dossier alleged that Shah’s “modus operandi” was to carry one or two stories every month based “entirely on the victimhood narrative that glorify stone pelters, terrorists and justify separatism and violence”.

“The SSP, Srinagar has reported in the dossier that being a head of ‘Kashmirwalla’ online news portal (thekashmirwalla.com) you are continuously propagating stories against the interest and security of the nation,” the dossier read.

The police alleged that journalist Fahad Shah is an “anti-national element under the cover of journalism” who propagated selective stories that corresponded with the propaganda of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, and separatists.

They also claimed to know of “a number of incidents” where Shah allegedly incited violence, leading to disturbance of public order. The police, however, did not state what these instances were.

The police alleged that Shah’s mindset could be deduced from his tweets.

“You are filled with hate against the Union of India and every layman can judge your intentions by visiting or accessing your social media timelines,” the statement said.

In the dossier, while justifying Shah’s arrest under the stringent law, the police alleged that he could pose a threat to the security of Jammu and Kashmir through alleged unlawful activities.

Police also claimed that Shah “did not mend his ways” despite “being given many chances”.

They added that Shah was not meant to be punished through preventive detention, but he was to be stopped from indulging in what they claimed are nefarious activities.

They also said that it was easy for Shah to brainwash people against the government since he had high educational credentials.

On March 16, Shah was shifted to the Kupwara district jail from the Soura police station in Srinagar.

The journalist was first arrested on February 4 by Pulwama Police for posting allegedly anti-national content on social media and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He was granted bail after 22 days by a National Investigation Agency court.

However, hours after he got bail on February 26, Shah was arrested again the same day by Shopian Police in another case related to provocation for riots. On March 5, he got bail in the second matter but was arrested immediately in another case.

In this case, Shah had been charged under Indian Penal Code sections that provide punishment for rioting, attempt to murder, abetment, printing or engraving defamatory matter and public mischief.

On March 11, he was charged under UAPA.

On February 6, several press bodies, including the Editors Guild, had demanded that Shah be released immediately. The Editors Guild had asked the authorities in the Union Territory to ensure that FIRs, intimidatory questioning and wrongful detainment were not used as tools for suppressing press freedom.

Besides Shah, Sajad Gul, another journalist from The Kashmir Walla, was detained under the Public Safety Act on January 16, a day after a court had given him bail in a criminal conspiracy case.

In its dossier for the use of the Act against Gul, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had justified the move suggesting he might be granted bail otherwise. The authorities had claimed that Gul’s release would be a threat not only to the Bandipora district, but to the entire Kashmir Valley."

Their defiance of Putin takes on a new meaning today . ,17/03/2022,United States,81503685-c207-f382-d8ed-3e9f216152c1,"In February 2012, on the altar of Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior where no women are allowed, Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina took guitars, “sang” — more accurately shouted — and asked Mother Mary, “Please, drive Putin away.” They were arrested and a third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, who did not make it to the altar, was also arrested. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina spent two years in prison. Samutesevich was released from jail early.

These women in their 20s had the guts to mock Vladimir Putin’s harsh regime and face the consequences.

My filmmaking partner, Natasha Fissiak and I went to Moscow in December 2012 to make a documentary about these women, the members of the punk rock group Pussy Riot, who tweaked Putin’s huge ego in the city’s largest cathedral. For 18 days, we filmed secretly in apartments and in the bitter cold during protests. Ten years later, Pussy Riot’s call for an uprising of the Russian people to “take Putin away” is even more poignant with his aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and today. Their defiant act has taken on new meaning as Putin attempts to subdue all of Ukraine. As I look back, those few days in Moscow gave me a taste of how afraid most Russians are of their government. What will it take to stop Putin? Who can stand up to him? How long will it take? Will the leaders in Moscow’s military and higher echelons of government show the world they have the courage of these women and say to Putin, “No more war in Ukraine”?

Police knocked on the door

My partner had been visiting family in Moscow during their trial. She came home politicized against their imprisonment. We dropped development of our feature film, “Empress of Texas,” about Ima Hogg, the art patron of Houston, and raised our initial budget for “Pussy Riot the Movement” within days.

I applied for and received a tourist visa rather than a business one, which would take much longer and receive more intensive scrutiny. A Swiss filmmaker, who wrote on his visa application he planned to make a different documentary on Pussy Riot never received his visa. It was clear, therefore, when we flew into Russia, officials at the airport would be searching for more than tobacco and alcohol.

Audio/visual equipment that could spread Western “propaganda” to the Russian people and the world would be suspect. We hired a Russian crew but needed hard drives to bring our footage back to the U.S. At customs, officials pulled three hard drives from our bags and asked why we had them. My partner, a citizen of the U.S. and Russia, explained they were for family photos and videos. Her pretty face and Russian passport convinced officials to release us. We were not about to tell anyone we were planning to give “hooligans,” as Pussy Riot was portrayed in court, a world platform — to feature three women who had the gall to spit in Putin’s misinformation eye.

Their “sacrilege” irked an important Putin champion. The Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church had supported Putin’s election and increasingly authoritarian rule. He said Pussy Riot was “doing the work of Satan” and should be punished. The two powerful leaders are symbiotic in efforts to convince the Russian people of their protection from the “evil West” and spiritual sustenance for devout souls. For worshipers strictly forbidden to practice their faith openly under communist oppression, Pussy Riot’s “blasphemy” — a profane punk rock song in church — was too much. Few Russians felt respect or sympathy for Pussy Riot.

When we arrived at our rented apartment for interviews with Russian artists, journalists and former Putin prisoners, a sour-faced receptionist warned we could not take cameras into the apartment as Putin routinely drove to the Kremlin on the street below. They meant to impress with anonymous phone calls telling us we were disturbing the peace. We moved our cameras to a second apartment.

Our team invited Samutesvich, the member of Pussy Riot who was released early, to dinner. Her arrival time was 8 p.m., but she ran late. That was lucky. At 8:15 p.m. two police officers knocked on the door, looked around and asked to see the apartment lease and my partner’s passport. Our executive producer offered them a drink and dinner, which they declined and left. Samutsevich arrived at 8:30 p.m. We did our interview without further interruption. Samutsevich talked about Putin’s control of misinformation. She said, “Mr. Putin can lie to the whole world and feel he is completely safe in doing it. Nobody will do anything to him.”

Once we had our documentary footage, my partner and I left Moscow from different airports, each carrying a hard drive. We left another one with our Russian crew and made it through customs without incident. The documentary was completed and had a five-city theatrical release, ran on multiple streaming sites and will be re-released soon.

Educated and afraid

Do the majority of Russians today support Putin’s attack on Ukraine? According to a February 27, 2022 report from the OVD-info rights group, thousands have taken to the streets of 51 cities across Russia to protest the war. Nearly 6,000 have been arrested. A petition — in Russian — on Change.org has 1.2 million signatures: https://www.change.org/m/stand-with-ukraine.

Given Russia’s rich history of art and literature it has one of the highest educational attainments in the world. Yet, I could not imagine living there in peace and comfort. Sighing with relief as we took off back to Houston, freedom never felt better. The women we interviewed who had been imprisoned by Putin clearly were fearful of speaking with us. That’s understandable given how widespread the threat of imprisonment is in Russia. One of the lawyers who represented Mikhail Khodorkovsky — an oligarch who was imprisoned for a decade for challenging Putin publicly — was arrested and spent four years in prison. He now lives in exile in Switzerland. As a gay mother of three, New Yorker journalist Masha Gessen self-exiled from Russia after the state enacted new homophobic legislation that threatened to take adopted children away from gay parents.

Living a mere 18 days under the threat of possible arrest is nothing compared to the fear that many Russians live with. My hope is that Pussy Riot’s defiance represents a future in which the younger generations manage to hold fair and free elections.

What are the members of Pussy Riot doing today? After the two were released from prison, they resumed criticism of Putin and are performing around the world. The Guardian reported recently that Nadya Tolokonnikova is in an undisclosed location and raised $7 million in five days through the sale of a non-fungible token, or NFT, of the Ukrainian flag.

If Putin continues his assault into NATO countries, the coward is either an utter fool or madman who is ready to die — and incinerate his people and ours. Let us hope Putin’s ego has limits and eventually self-preservation takes over — that he is not a madman, that talks will lead to a ceasefire and the threats of a nuclear holocaust fades from the world.

Making “Pussy Riot the Movement” was the experience of a lifetime. I had been fascinated by Russia and wanted to see the world-famous Bolshoi Ballet since age nine after watching the movie, “Never Let Me Go.” Clark Gable, playing an American journalist, married a Russian ballerina played by Gene Tierney whose character was prohibited from leaving the country. Perhaps that hero who fooled the Russians and sneaked Tierney out influenced my choice of journalism as a career. I did not make it to the ballet in Moscow, but the world-class Houston Ballet is my favorite now and I continue to love Russian culture and the many Russian friends I’ve made. We have to remember that many Russians do not want this war and they reject Putin.

Back in 2012, Samutsevich explained, “We have developed a culture of protest which did not exist in Russia…to educate ourselves, to see what’s happening in other countries…and take only the best and try it in Russia.” Maybe some day a younger generation of Russians will take the wisdom in her words and make the changes for which Pussy Riot risked their freedom, even their lives, in Putin’s Russia.

25,https://www.omct.org/en/resources/statements/ukraine-grave-human-rights-violations-in-territories-under-recent-russian-control,Ukraine : Grave human rights violations in territories under … ,17/03/2022,Egypt,8c6becbf-95e7-1a89-6fe8-c4ae5c9c77a3,"Geneva-Brussels, March 16, 2022 – As the Russian Federation extends its control of Ukrainian territories a systematic policy of grave human rights violations is unfolding. At least six cases of enforced disappearances and four extrajudicial killings of civilians have been documented in the recently occupied regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv and Luhansk. These patterns are similar to those already documented in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine since 2014, where torture, kidnappings and executions have become the norm under Russian occupation.

As the Russian army secures control over some territories in Ukraine, the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and its Ukrainian partners have documented at least six cases of enforced disappearances and incommunicado arbitrary detention, as well as at least four extrajudicial executions of journalists, human rights defenders and representatives of local authorities in March 2022 alone. This very worrying trend indicates that the Russian forces may be as negligent of human rights in the occupation of these territories as they were during the conflict, when the army shelled civilians and humanitarian corridors.

Grave human rights violations targeting human rights defenders, journalists and activists

On March 12, 2022, Oleg Baturin, a Ukrainian journalist working for the Novy Den newspaper and member of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine (NUJU), was allegedly abducted by Russian soldiers in the Kherson region. At about 4 pm, Oleg Baturin received a call from an acquaintance who proposed to meet him at a bus station located near the journalist’s house, in the town of Kakhovka. Oleg Baturin left his phone and documents at home, and promised to be back in 20 minutes. The journalist’s whereabouts have remained unknown since then. On the same day, at around 4:50 pm, Russian soldiers were seen by locals near the Kakhovka bus station, where Oleg Baturin was supposed to meet his acquaintance.

On the same day, a pro-Ukrainian activist and journalist Serhiy Tsyhipa disappeared in the neighbouring town of Nova Kakhovka, in the Kherson region. Serhiy Tsyhipa left home with his dog at 10 am. The dog was later found tied up near the building of the town executive committee. Serhiy Tsyhipa has not been in touch since then, and his family has no official information about his whereabouts. His daughter found out that he was being held in detention in Kherson in order to prevent him from spreading unwanted information about the war in the region. Before his enforced disappearance he covered the news of the occupied town.

On March 11, 2022, at 3 pm, the Russian military abducted Ivan Fedorov, the Mayor of Melitopol town, by breaking into the town hall. According to the Mayor’s Office of Melitopol, the Russian military pulled a black plastic bag over Fedorov’s head, forced him out of his office, put him in a car and drove him away in an unknown direction. This version seemed to be corroborated by a video from security cameras. On March 14, 2022, the Ukrainian authorities reported that Ivan Fedorov was detained in the occupied town of Luhansk and was charged with “terrorism”. It should be noted that, shortly before his arrest, Ivan Fedorov refused to issue a statement legitimizing the Russian invasion. On March 16, 2022, the Office of the President of Ukraine reported that Ivan Fedorov was released in exchange for 9 captured Russian soldiers.

On March 12, 2022, Olga Haisumova, Head of the NGO ""Melitopol Conscious Society"" and one of organizers of a pro-Ukrainian protest in occupied Melitopol, was kidnapped by Russian soldiers straight from the protest rally in Melitopol . Her whereabouts have remained unknown since then. NGO ""Melitopol Conscious Society"" conducted charitable collections of food and financial support for the Ukrainian army, and coordinated civil actions in support of the sovereignty of Ukraine.

According to Ukrainian media reports, rallies against the Russian invasion have been met with violence. Russian troops tried to disperse protesters by shooting in the air. One participant to a pro-Ukrainian rally in Kherson was wounded in the leg by a rubber bullet.

Grave human rights violations targeting Ukrainian political representatives

Ukrainian media report that on the morning of March 13, 2022, the Head of the Melitopol District Council Serhiy Pryima was detained by eight Russian military men who broke into his apartment to conduct a raid. During the raid, the military confiscated all his documents and mobile devices, and demanded his passwords. After the raid, the Russian military took Serhiy Pryyma away in an unknown direction. His whereabouts have remained unknown since then.

On March 13, 2022, the Head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration announced that the Russian military had kidnapped Yevhen Matveyev, the Mayor of the Dniprorudne town in the Zaporizhzhia Region. On March 14, 2022, Ukrainian authorities reported that his whereabouts remained unknown.

Member of Parliament Dmytro Lubinets informed Ukrainian human rights organisations about the detention by the Russian military of more than 20 pro-Ukrainian activists in the city of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region. Their names are unknown and this information could not be verified upon publication of this note.

Cases of extrajudicial executions of local politicians and civil activists have also been confirmed in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.

The local self-government body of the Gostomel village, in the Kyiv region, reported that on March 7, 2022, Yuriy Prylypko, the Head of this local self-government, was shot dead by the Russian military along with two volunteers Ruslan Karpenko and Ivan Zorya, while they were delivering food and medicine to local residents.

On March 13, 2022, the Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration reported that the Russian military had killed pro-Ukrainian activist Oleksandr Kononov, who was shot dead in his wheelchair in his home near Severodonetsk city, Luhansk region.

Conclusions and recommendations

The above-mentioned attacks seem to demonstrate that in the territories under Russian military control, two groups of civilians are particularly targeted: 1) local authorities or opinion leaders who openly oppose collaboration with the occupiers, and 2) pro-Ukrainian activists and humanitarian volunteers who provide assistance to the civilian population.

The OMCT recalls that similar attacks have been documented in Russian-occupied Crimea and eastern Ukraine since 2014.

More wide-scale persecution of civilian population is to be feared in the territories fallen under Russian control, in the form of attacks, enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions.

We call on the international community to urge the authorities of the Russian Federation to:

Immediately and unconditionally release all the above-mentioned persons; Guarantee in all circumstances their physical integrity and psychological well-being as well as that of all civilians, including human rights defenders, pro-Ukrainian activists, journalists and representatives of local self-government bodies in Ukrainian territories under Russian control; Ensure international monitoring and humanitarian work in Ukraine without any hindrance or reprisals.

We further call on the international community to provide support to Ukrainian non-governmental organisations in all forms relevant in the present-day situation of armed conflict."

His visit to Saudi Arabia comes just days after the state executed 81 people in the largest known mass execution in the kingdom in modern history.

The Prime Minister also met with United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, which also has capital punishment and a long history of detaining political opponents.

Here we look at some of the worst examples carried out by the states in recent years.

Mass execution of 81 people

The event last Saturday signalled an “appalling escalation” in Saudi Arabia’s use of the death penalty, Amnesty International said. The individuals had been convicted of a wide range of offences, ranging from murder and armed robbery to “disrupting the social fabric and national cohesion” and “participating in and inciting sit-ins and protests”.

Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said: “This execution spree is all the more chilling in light of Saudi Arabia’s deeply flawed justice system, which metes out death sentences following trials that are grossly and blatantly unfair, including basing verdicts on “confessions” extracted under torture or other ill-treatment.”

92 executions so far this year

So far in 2022, 92 people have been executed in Saudi Arabia. Last year the reported 67 executions included Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish, who was arrested in 2015 for protest-related offences when he was aged 17. The charges included ""seeking to disturb security by rioting"" and ""sowing discord”.

Human rights groups said his trial had been unfair and came despite assurances the kingdom had abolished the death penalty for minors. His family received no warning about the execution in advance and only learned about it online.

The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been largely shunned by the West after it was alleged he ordered the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. The US-based journalist was a vocal critic of Saudi Arabia’s rulers and was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018.

A UN investigation concluded his death ""constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible” and there was ""credible evidence"" to warrant an investigation into Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials. Instead, a Saudi court sentenced eight men found responsible for the murder to prison terms of seven to 20 years in a trial criticised for lacking transparency.

Raif Badawi

Prominent blogger and human rights defender Raif Badawi was detained by Saudi authorities in 2012 and subsequently jailed for creating an online forum for public debate and accusations that he insulted Islam. He was also sentenced to a punishment of 1000 lashes, the first 50 of which were meted out in a public square in 2015.

Mohamed al-Bokari

Yemeni LGBTI rights defender Mohamed al-Bokari is thought to still be in jail in Saudia Arabia after being sentenced to 10 months in prison for charges related to ""violating public morality, promoting homosexuality online and imitating women"". He was arrested after he appeared in a video supporting the rights of LGBTI people.

War in Yemen

There are human rights concerns over the role of Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, including reports of unlawful airstrikes that have killed and injured civilians. Saudi Arabia has led a coalition against Iran-backed rebels for years, causing a disastrous economic slide in Yemen. The UN has warned of mass starvation and famine over rising hunger levels.

Political parties and demonstrations banned in UAE

In the UAE, which comprises seven sheikhdoms run by ruling families, political parties and demonstrations are banned. In July 2013, a group of 94 including lawyers, university lecturers and students were accused of trying to seize power in the Emirates and 60 remain jailed as of last year.

The trial of the UAE-94 was criticised by human rights groups, which said “credible” allegations of torture were not investigated. Last year a report by a UN expert found a group of the activists still in prison were enduring conditions that may amount to torture -which was denied by the UAE.

Mary Lawlor, the UN's special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, also said they ""never been detained in the first place for legitimately exercising the freedoms that all people are entitled to.”

Persecution of Ahmed Mansoor

Ahmed Mansoor, is known as the UAE’s most celebrated human rights activist, including winning an award for raising concerns about arbitrary detention, torture and degrading treatment in the Gulf state. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 for ""defaming"" the country on social media.

Human rights groups say authorities have refused all requests to make the charges and court rulings public and that he has been held in an isolation cell deprived of basic necessities.

Conditions for migrant workers

The sponsorship system for migrant workers which exists in the UAE has long raised concerns over leaving many foreign nationals vulnerable to exploitation and forced labour. It ties the visas of migrant workers to their employers, meaning they cannot change jobs or leave without permission. If they do, workers face punishment for “absconding”, including fines, prison and deportation.

Last year, Amnesty International highlighted the detention and deportation of at least 375 African migrant workers, reporting they had been seized from their homes during the night, detained incommunicado for up to two months in prison and deported without any due process.

Treatment of women

Women remain unequal with men under Emirati law, according to the most recent report in 2020 by Amnesty International. By law, married women are obliged to “look after the house” as a “right” held by husbands –although legislation had been amended to remove a husband’s right to “courteous obedience” from his wife. Judges however can still determine whether a married woman is permitted to leave the house and to work."

Judicial authorities in Rwanda are prosecuting opposition members, journalists, and commentators on the basis of their speech and opinions, Human Rights Watch said today. Throughout 2020 and 2021, Human Rights Watch monitored trials in which judicial authorities pursued politically motivated prosecutions and perpetuated a culture of intolerance of dissent.

Less than two years out from the 2024 presidential election campaign season, the Rwandan government should ensure an end to violations against civil society activists, journalists, and opposition figures. The government should also protect their right to freedom of expression – a precondition to creating a conducive environment for free and fair elections.

“Judicial authorities in Rwanda, lacking the independence to stand up and protect free speech in accordance with international law, have unjustly convicted and jailed people based on their protected speech and opinions,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “All those jailed unjustly should be immediately and unconditionally released, and the abusive legal framework that allowed their prosecution should be reviewed and brought in line with international free speech standards.”

Since the publication of a March 2021 report on the arrests of, and threats against, several Rwandans for posts on YouTube, Human Rights Watch has monitored trials and reviewed trial documents and verdicts to examine the evidence and arguments of prosecutorial authorities, and the basis for judges’ rulings.

Researchers also reviewed content published on various channels managed by journalists and commentators on trial and interviewed 11 opposition members and people who post on YouTube. The cases documented are not exhaustive – Human Rights Watch also received information about other similar cases.

On March 3, 2022, Human Rights Watch wrote a letter to Justice Minister Emmanuel Ugirashebuja to share information about the cases it has documented and to request information on the Rwandan authorities’ steps to address violations of the right to freedom of expression. The government has not responded.

Rwanda has very few opposition parties, and human rights organizations and independent media remain weak. Victoire Ingabire, who was the president of the unregistered opposition party FDU-Inkingi before founding Dalfa-Umurinzi in November 2019, was released from prison in 2018. Members of her party have repeatedly been harassed, threatened, and arrested, or have died or disappeared in suspicious circumstances. Since October 2021, at least eight members of her party have been arrested and charged with offenses, including spreading rumors and forming a criminal association, in relation to a book they acquired and an online training session they attended to learn strategies for peaceful dissent.

Journalists using YouTube as a platform have also been targeted for prosecution for not registering with the Rwanda Media Commission (RMC) or for publishing information that contradicts the government’s version of certain events, such as the suspicious death in custody of Kizito Mihigo, a gospel singer and activist, or disappearances of government opponents.

The cases of Dieudonné Niyonsenga – alias Cyuma Hassan – and Théoneste Nsengimana, which Human Rights Watch documented, could further erode journalists’ legal protections and narrow the space for media and online speech. Niyonsenga, a high-profile YouTuber, was found guilty on appeal of forgery, impersonation, hindering public works, and “humiliation of national authorities and persons in charge of public service.” The last charge, which was added during the first appeal, is no longer a criminal offense in Rwanda. The prosecution authority announced it was lodging a “second appeal” to correct the error. Its verdict is expected on March 18. On March 9, Human Rights Watch received reports and confirmed that Ishema TV was no longer available on YouTube. At time of writing, it is unclear whether the channel was removed voluntarily.

Since 1994, speaking about crimes committed by the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in the aftermath of the genocide, or sometimes even simply commemorating Hutu who were killed during the genocide, is perceived as crossing a red line, with the government presenting it as a threat to Rwandan unity, or the country’s security as a whole.

“When you are pro-government, you don’t have any problems. When you talk about bad things, you become persecuted, you are a genocide denier,” one YouTuber told Human Rights Watch.

Another said, “They take one word, and they create a crime for you…. Here, the problem is talking the truth. If you do, they go after you.”

The Rwandan government may have legitimate grounds to seek to restrict the kind of dangerous, vitriolic speech that led to the deaths of over half a million people in 1994, but current laws and practices go far beyond this purpose – creating fear and effectively stifling opinions, debate, and criticism of the government.

As Rwanda approaches the 30-year mark since the genocide, and the government aims to ramp up efforts to combat genocide ideology, there is a need to ensure that Rwandans can peacefully express legitimate grievances related to the genocide and post-genocide periods, Human Rights Watch said.

Article 38 of the 2015 Constitution protects freedom of expression but limits that protection by permitting ill-defined restrictions based on “public order, good morals, the protection of the youth and children, the right of every citizen to honor and dignity and protection of personal and family privacy.” The government, with the support of the judiciary, has used this clawback clause to impose restrictions on freedom of expression in ways that are incompatible with Rwanda’s regional and international obligations.

As Rwanda prepares to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, scheduled to take place in June, the international community should take a stand and press the authorities to stop harassing, immediately release, and drop all charges against opposition members, YouTube commentators and journalists facing abusive prosecutions that violate freedom of expression. The authorities should also open credible, independent, and transparent investigations into suspicious deaths and disappearances of critics, opposition members, civil society actors, and journalists, and prosecute those responsible.

“The evidence provided by the prosecuting authorities, and what judges have chosen to rely on to justify their conclusions, clearly demonstrates that these cases violate African and international human rights law,” Mudge said. “Prosecuting those who challenge the government of incitement to insurrection or of attempting to tarnish the country’s image is an indication of how little dissent is tolerated in Rwanda.”

For details of the recent cases, please see below.

Cases Against the Political Opposition

In October 2021, at least eight members of Victoire Ingabire’s opposition party, Dalfa-Umurinzi, were arrested in the largest crackdown against the party in recent years. Sylvain Sibomana, Alexis Rucubanganya, Hamad Hagenimana, Jean-Claude Ndayishimiye, Alphonse Mutabazi, Marcel Nahimana, and Emmanuel Masengesho were all detained in the days leading up to and following “Ingabire day,” scheduled for October 14.

On that day, Ingabire was planning to speak about political repression in Rwanda, cases of suspicious deaths, killings, disappearances, and abusive prosecutions. Théoneste Nsengimana, a journalist who was planning to cover the event, was arrested on October 13 and is being tried with the group of seven.

Criminal charges of “spreading false information or harmful propaganda with intent to cause a hostile international opinion against Rwandan government” and “formation of or joining a criminal association” were brought against Sibomana, Rucubanganya, Hagenimana, Ndayishimiye, Mutabazi, Nahimana, and Masengesho. On November 9, during a pretrial hearing, the Kicukiro court said it is also considering evidence to support other, undetermined charges against them. The prosecution contended that the defendants were also responsible for inciting insurrection.

Claudine Uwimana, a party member who was arrested on December 14 in Rutsiro, is being tried separately. She is charged with spreading false information, publishing rumors, forming a criminal association, and inciting insurrection, and has been denied bail.

The arrests send a clear message to those who may wish to mobilize, organize, or campaign on a political platform in the lead-up to the elections that efforts to peacefully change the power structures in place can be considered a criminal offense, Human Rights Watch said.

In both cases, the prosecution based its accusations on the group’s decision to acquire “Blueprint for Revolution,” a book written by Srdja Popovic, and to follow a training organized by the author’s organization, Canvas – the Center for Applied Non-Violent Actions and Strategies. Both the book and the training focus on peaceful strategies to resist authoritarianism, such as nonviolent protest, noncooperation, boycott, and mobilization. The prosecution used as evidence the contents of the book and training, the use of Jitsi – an encrypted online communication platform – and the use of pseudonyms during the training.

The prosecution also accused the group of planning activities such as mobilizing, among others, street vendors and others who are routinely rounded up and subjected to abuse, and a commemoration of political activists and critics who have died, disappeared, or been jailed, on “Ingabire Day,” based on the strategies proposed during the training.

Social protest and mobilization offer people the opportunity to peacefully communicate legitimate complaints and grievances. Governments have a responsibility to create a safe and enabling environment for individuals and groups to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression, and of association.

Dieudonné Niyonsenga, also known as “Cyuma Hassan,” runs Ishema TV, a popular YouTube channel on which he has published his sensitive and critical reports. Ishema TV has millions of views, and Niyonsenga is one of the most popular YouTube contributors in Rwanda.

In April 2020, police arrested Niyonsenga and his driver, Fidèle Komezusenge, as they were reporting on the impact of the Covid-19 guidelines on vulnerable populations in a poor neighborhood of Kigali. Niyonsenga and Komezusenge were accused of forgery, impersonating journalists, and hindering public works for being outside during lockdown without a valid RMC-issued press card. Both spent almost a year in detention, but then were acquitted on March 12, 2021. After his release, Niyonsenga gave several interviews on YouTube describing his treatment in detention. In one, he said:

“At first, I think they accused me of seven offenses. It was a lot. They were forcing me to talk but I refused as long as I didn’t have a lawyer.… They took me to several police stations, I only spent one night in each cell. Finally, my lawyer spoke with them…. [In Nyarugenge prison,] I was imprisoned in a one-meter-by-one-meter cell, filled with water and mosquitos. I was not allowed out to exercise.”

After his acquittal and release, Niyonsenga continued to do critical and sensitive reporting, including investigating alleged abuses by the military. The prosecution successfully appealed the verdict and on November 11, 2021, Niyonsenga was arrested again at his home while Komezusenge was acquitted.

The appeals court found Niyonsenga guilty of forgery, impersonation, hindering public works, and “humiliation of national authorities and persons in charge of public service.” The last charge, which was added during the appeal, is no longer a criminal offense in Rwanda. It was struck down from the 2018 Penal Code by the Supreme Court in 2019. The prosecution authority of Rwanda tweeted on November 16 that “Prosecution has lodged a 2nd appeal in the case against Niyonsenga Dieudonné alias Cyuma Hassan. The grounds for appeal is to correct an error convicting Cyuma for the crime of humiliating public service officials, a crime that was repealed in 2019.”

That Niyonsenga was convicted of a crime that no longer exists in the Penal Code – the humiliation of national authorities – violates his right to a fair trial by a competent and impartial court. International law requires an effective remedy for anyone whose fair trial rights are violated.

During the first appeal’s hearings, the prosecution argued that Niyonsenga had practiced journalism and presented an Ishema TV card stating he was a journalist without being registered with the so-called self-regulatory RMC. The court found that although Rwanda’s media law allows any individual to obtain and impart information online, the fact that Niyonsenga presented himself as a journalist, without accreditation from the RMC, was misleading the public and a crime.

The prosecution argued that even though Niyonsenga, who studied journalism and worked for other registered media before establishing Ishema TV, applied to RMC for accreditation on April 4, 2021, and paid the 20,000 Rwandan Francs fee (US$20), journalism was comparable to medical and legal practice in that it required “necessary” authorization and qualifications to practice. It contended that the fact that Niyonsenga practiced journalism before having registered was grounds to convict him.

Requirements for journalists to register are rarely, if ever justifiable, and in a context of repression like Rwanda, they are used politically to curtail speech, Human Rights Watch said. Under international law, everyone has a right to obtain information and express oneself online. In its General Comment 34 on the right to freedom of expression, the UN reaffirmed that licensing requirements or other efforts to penalize media “solely for being critical of the government or the political social system espoused by the government can never be considered to be a necessary restriction of freedom of expression.”

The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights’ 2019 Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa obligates governments to guarantee the right to establish various forms of independent media, including online media, and states that “Any registration system for media shall be for administrative purposes only, and shall not impose excessive fees or other restrictions on the media.”

Théoneste Nsengimana

Théoneste Nsengimana, who runs Umubavu TV, was first arrested in April 2020 and held in pretrial detention on accusations of fraud. On April 12, 2020, the Rwandan Investigation Bureau (RIB) tweeted confirmation of Nsengimana’s arrest for alleged fraud. RIB accused him of promising 20,000 Rwandan Francs ($20) to people to say they were receiving assistance from abroad “for the purpose of soliciting the story for his own benefit.”

A Kicukiro court ordered Nsengimana’s release from pretrial detention in May 2020 due to the prosecution’s lack of evidence against him, and the charges were eventually dropped. Since his release, Nsengimana’s YouTube channel has hosted sensitive and critical discussions on current affairs, including with a YouTube commentator, Aimable Karasira, who is now also in prison.

Nsengimana was arrested again on October 13, 2021, as part of a broader crackdown against Ingabire’s opposition party Dalfa-Umurinzi after his channel announced its intention to cover the “Ingabire Day” event.

The prosecution contends that Nsengimana used his YouTube channel to broadcast false information, including a video by activist Mireille Kagabo. The video was shared in the lead-up to “Ingabire day,” in which she called on people to commemorate “heroes” and “political prisoners.” She listed names and cases, including the suspicious death of Kizito Mihigo, the activist and gospel singer, in February 2020, the suspicious disappearance of Cassien Ntamuhanga, a journalist who was forcibly disappeared after being detained in Mozambique in May 2021, and the enforced disappearance and flawed trial of Paul Rusesabagina, a prominent government critic who was convicted of terrorism-related charges. Nsengimana has been charged with “spreading false information or harmful propaganda with intent to cause a hostile international opinion against the Rwandan government.”

The case is most likely designed to send a message not to question the government’s version of events in cases of suspicious deaths, enforced disappearances, and prosecutions of critics and dissidents, Human Rights Watch said.

Dangers of Sensitive Commentary

Government officials have threatened, intimidated, and brought abusive prosecutions against several commentators using YouTube as a platform to self-publish commentary or artistic content. Innocent Bahati, a popular poet who published his work focusing on social and human rights issues on YouTube, remains missing over a year after he disappeared in suspicious circumstances on February 7, 2021. Recently, and after public pressure on the government to disclose his whereabouts increased, the RIB spokesperson told the media that Bahati had crossed into Uganda and that he had been working with “anti-Rwanda” elements, without providing any supporting evidence.

Aimable Karasira

Aimable Karasira, a Tutsi and former information communication technology professor at the University of Rwanda, has spoken about losing family members both to Hutu extremists and to the RPF in 1994 on his YouTube channel called “Ukuri Mbona” (“the truth I see” in Kinyarwanda).

In July 2020, Edouard Bamporiki, culture and youth minister, attacked Karasira on social media and said he should not be allowed to teach. Karasira was dismissed from the University of Rwanda on August 14, 2020, for “the expression of attitudes and opinions through controversial statements” and “spreading information intended for inciting people to dislike or dishonor your institution and public institutions in general.” Karasira later said in a YouTube video that he was summoned to the RIB office on December 8, 2020, where he was told to stop talking about the genocide.

On May 31, 2021, the RIB announced the arrest of Karasira for offenses under Rwanda’s genocide ideology law. His trial is ongoing.

During Karasira’s July 27, 2021, pretrial hearing, the prosecution cited one of his interviews to support the charges of genocide denial and justification, and divisionism. The prosecution cited excerpts from an interview with Agnès Nkusi Uwimana, a journalist who runs a YouTube channel, on May 23, 2021.

The prosecution contended that Karasira’s statement that the downing of then-president Juvénal Habyarimana’s plane in April 1994 “became the trigger point for the genocide,” constitutes genocide denial. His comments regarding the arrest of former prominent businessman under Habyarimana and one of the alleged masterminds of the Rwandan genocide, Félicien Kabuga, claiming that he was “in court because he did not give money to the RPF like other businessmen, [and] saying that it’s because of the machetes he provided [during the genocide] is not true because every household had a machete” were presented as minimizing the genocide.

In addition, the prosecution is arguing that his claim that the RPF had attacked Rwanda prior to the genocide is justification for the genocide and that saying “Rwanda was not liberated (by the RPF) … we [the survivors] became their sacrifice” to justify their rule constitutes divisionism.

On May 30, the day before his arrest, Karasira published another video on his YouTube channel in which he gave details of his family’s history, contending that his mother may have been killed in 1994 by the RPF because she witnessed their crimes. After the genocide, he said, he was prevented from receiving the benefits afforded to genocide survivors because of his family’s history.

Rwandan laws on genocide ideology, which may have been intended to prevent and punish hate speech of the kind that led to the 1994 genocide, have restricted free speech and imposed strict limits on how people can talk about the genocide and other events of 1994. This case illustrates the extent to which these broad laws can be manipulated to silence those who wish to talk about the RPF’s crimes in the aftermath of the genocide or challenge the official narrative around the genocide – even survivors themselves.

Yvonne Idamange

Yvonne Idamange, a Tutsi online commentator who has criticized the Covid-19 lockdown and the government-organized genocide commemorations, was arrested on February 15, 2021, after posting a video in which she falsely claimed that President Kagame was dead, and called for the army to serve the people or face the wrath of God, and for Rwandans to march with their Bibles toward the office of the president.

In her first YouTube video, Idamange criticized the monetization of genocide memorials for tourism, in which “the bodies of our relatives are being sold” and questioned notions of collective guilt and the government’s approach to commemorations.

On September 30, 2021, the High Court Chamber for International Crimes, where Idamange’s trial took place behind closed doors, convicted her of inciting insurrection, minimizing the genocide, desecrating a memorial site, spreading rumors, rebellion against authorities, and issuing a check that bounced. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined 2 million Rwandan Francs ($1,930).

The court convicted Idamange on the basis of statements she made in videos she published on YouTube before her arrest. The court found that her statements that “Covid-19 has become a pretext, worsened for political gains … that state institutions are ghosts and don’t do their work…. That the Rwandan state is a state of crooks, bandits, and thieves … that Rwanda is a country without a shepherd and that Rwandans are in mourning and should march to Urugwiro to ask for the body of Paul Kagame” constitutes inciting insurrection and unrest.

In addition, the court found that Idamange’s statements that “the Rwandan state threatens genocide survivors by killing people, exposing dead bodies, that it’s a government that no longer exists … that the country has no president … the country is governed by a dead body” constitutes publication of rumors. Her criticism of the monetization of memorial sites and accusations that genocide survivors are “ignored” were found to be desecration of a memorial site and genocide minimization.

Many Rwandans have told Human Rights Watch they felt Idamange’s statements went too far, including her false claims that President Paul Kagame was dead and her call for Rwandans to march towards the presidency. However, Idamange’s treatment during her arrest, the severity of the criminal charges brought against her, the opaque nature of her trial, and the disproportionately harsh sentence handed out appear designed to intimidate anyone thinking of expressing critical, sensitive, or controversial views on the genocide.

Rwandan authorities’ efforts to combat genuine genocide denial should not involve criminal penalties for mere speech and should not attempt or aim to stifle legitimate and necessary discussion and debate on historical events, Human Rights Watch said. The criminal law, or any laws that create vaguely defined offenses, should not be used to prevent people challenging official versions of events.

Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel 1, was detained after she ran on to the set on Monday holding an anti-war sign.



The sign, clearly visible for a few seconds, read: ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.""



Her whereabouts are now unknown.



Ovsyannikova's lawyer, Pavel Chikov, posted on Twitter that he was unable to find his client.



""Marina Ovsyannikova has not yet been found. She has been imprisoned for more than 12 hours,"" he said on Tuesday morning.



He said the initial police investigation ""does not provide grounds for detention and imprisonment"".



Police arrested her over a new law that bans calling Russia's military action in Ukraine an ""invasion"" or spreading ""fake news"" about the conflict.



Though the strictest punishments carry a potential prison sentence of up to 15 years, Chikov said Ovsyannikova was likely to be fined 30,000 to 60,000 roubles (£205-£410).



During the protest, which happened live on Russia's main nightly news programme, Ms Ovsyannikova said, ""No to war! Stop the war!"" before the programme director cut early to a recorded news report.



Before the incident she recorded a video in which she called events in Ukraine a ""crime"" and said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda.



""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained. ""We just silently watched this inhumane regime.""



Ovsyannikova, who said her father was Ukrainian, called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying that only they could ""stop the madness"".



""Don't be afraid of anything, they can't imprison all of us,"" she said.



From the moment Ovsyannikova's identity became known, she has received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions.



Ukraine's President Zelensky also praised her for ""telling the truth"".



But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called her actions an act of hooliganism.



Russian television news has long been controlled by the Kremlin and independent viewpoints are rare on all the major channels.



State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, describing Ukraine's elected government as neo-Nazis.



Several of the remaining independent media outlets in Russia have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow, and TV Rain - an online TV channel.



Others, like newspaper Novaya Gazeta, are attempting to report on the situation without falling foul of the new censorship laws.



Access to the BBC has also been restricted inside Russia, leading the corporation to issue guidance over how to continue using its services.



Russia's media watchdog accused the BBC and other foreign broadcasters of the ""deliberate and systematic circulation of materials containing false information"".



Many social media sites have also been blocked, further restricting the number and diversity of news sources available to people inside Russia.



Facebook and Twitter have been restricted for several days, while Instagram - which is particularly popular in Russia - was blocked on Monday, although many Russians have found ways round the restrictions. — BBC"

JournalismPakistan.com August 11, 2016





The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), Reprieve, Index of Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and 21 other international press freedom organizations have demanded the immediate release of UK-Bangladeshi journalist, Shafik Rehman, who has been in police custody since April 16, 2016.



Rehman, an 81-year-old prominent journalist was arrested on April 16 on allegations of participating in a conspiracy to murder Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina. Since his arrest, Rehman has been in police custody, where his family has claimed that he was in solitary confinement and denied medical care.



The joint letter that was sent to Bangladeshi Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Anisul Huq, called for Shafik’s immediate release on the grounds that after more than three months since his arrest, he has been detained without charge and his health is deteriorating.



The letter said: “Mr Rehman was arrested on 16 April 2016 and denied bail by the High Court on 7 June 2016. After more than three months in detention, he has still not been charged with any crime. Under international law, the Bangladesh authorities have a duty to promptly inform Mr Rehman of the nature of the case against him and either charge or release him. The delays in this case suggest that there is no evidence against Mr Rehman, and that he should be released.”



Rehman, a veteran journalist and editor, was the long-time editor of Jai Jai Din, a mass-circulation Bengali daily, and, at the time of his arrest, he edited a popular Bengali monthly magazine called Mouchake Dhil. He was also an advisor to opposition leader Khaleda Zia, the prime minister's arch-rival.



Rehman’s arrest has come amid government crackdowns on freedom of expression and press freedom in Bangladesh. Rehman is the third pro-opposition editor to be detained since 2013. This year alone the government has jailed Mahmudur Rahman, the acting editor of pro-opposition Amar Desh daily which was shut down after his arrest in April 2013, on slew of charges including sedition and he is also being investigated over a plot to kidnap and murder Joy alongside Shafik.

More recently, earlier this week the Bangladesh Telecommunications and Regulatory Commission (BTRC) ordered the shutdown of 35 websites including pro-opposition Sheersha News and Amar Desh Online, with BTRC claiming they were blocked ‘for making objectionable comments about the government’. On August 8, Bangladeshi police arrested three journalists from banglamail24.com following a story addressing rumours that Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, had been killed.



The IFJ said: “The arrest and extended detention of Shafik Rehman raises serious concerns about the state of press freedom in Bangladesh, which continues to decline. The media in Bangladesh is under constant threat, and Shafik Rehman is illustrative of this dire situation. The IFJ joins press freedom groups in demanding the immediate release of Rehman. The IFJ and its affiliates will continue to campaign for Rehman’s release and for press freedom in Bangladesh.” - IFJ media release

32,https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/national/sri-lanka-hr-abuses-worsening-cardinal/ar-AATSIvG,Sri Lanka HR abuses worsening – cardinal,15/02/2022,United States,d9d57931-1d31-a13c-4b5e-ebd9ffd467f4,"COLOMBO: The leader of Sri Lanka's Roman Catholic Church launched a scathing attack on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government Tuesday over what he called increasing threats to human rights on the troubled island.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith condemned Monday's attack on a high-profile TV journalist and the ""abduction"" of a campaigner for justice for the 279 people killed in the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings.

""Police have demonstrated uncivilized barbaric behavior in arresting a young man — Shehan Malaka — who is seeking justice for the Easter attack victims,"" the Cardinal told reporters in Colombo.

He said police in civilian clothing and traveling in a white van grabbed Malaka from the streets on Monday and his life was saved only because he broadcast his abduction live on social media.

""If he didn't have the presence of mind to use his phone for a live (broadcast), we wouldn't ever get to know what happened to him,"" the head of Sri Lanka's minority Catholic community said. ""He would have disappeared.""

""The police behavior is uncivilized and they acted like barbarians,"" Ranjith said.

White vans were commonly used by unidentified attackers to kidnap people during a previous Rajapaksa administration when thousands disappeared.

Malaka was taken before a magistrate and released on bail Tuesday after a social media outcry. Police said they arrested him on a ""hate speech"" charge for allegedly bringing the government into disrepute.

Malaka had also spearheaded a Catholic church protest campaign to fly black flags last year to condemn slow progress in police investigations into the Easter bombings, which targeted three churches and three deluxe hotels.

Home-grown Muslim fundamentalists were held responsible for the attack, but the authorities failed to identify the masterminds.

The Cardinal said Sri Lanka's overall human rights record was deteriorating, urging his followers to remain vigilant and resort to legal action.

Sri Lanka is on the agenda later this month at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva — which has repeatedly censured Colombo for failing to implement pledges to ensure accountability for rights abuses, particularly toward the end of the island's ethnic war in 2009.

""Why would they behave like this at a time when they are preparing to defend their record in Geneva?"" Ranjith asked.

""I think they don't have any brains.""

Sri Lankan rights groups have also condemned Monday's attack on the home of TV presenter Chamuditha Samarawickarama, who had criticized the powerful ruling Rajapaksa family and their allies in recent broadcasts."

There no trial in sight – The Forward",15/02/2022,Israel,fef432ae-82c3-baa8-51ff-27e34eadfd32,"Amal Nakhleh and his father Muammar, during better times. (Photo courtesy Haaretz)

This article originally appeared on Haaretz, and was reprinted here with permission.

What do the Shin Bet security service and the Israel Defense Forces have against a teenager in high school, whose father says he doesn’t know the difference between ideology and biology, who suffers from a rare autoimmune disease and who in 2020 underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his chest? Why do they imprison him repeatedly, without trial, without an indictment, without any consideration for his age or his health?

No one knows what the suspicions are against Amal Nakhleh, who was in the 11th grade at the time of his first and second arrests, whose father is the director general of a broadcasting company in Ramallah and whose mother is a gynecologist in the Jalazun refugee camp, near that same city. Not does anyone know how long the teenager will remain in prison – apparently for stone throwing. Two Israeli military judges have already ordered his release after examining the security information in his case, but the larger predatory system has insisted on keeping him jailed, and to that end, has issued an administrative detention order – incarceration without trial; arbitrary and unconstitutional – that is renewed every few months. That has happened several times so far, and the end is not necessarily looming on the horizon.

As if his disease and the operation he underwent weren’t enough, last week Nakhleh also fell ill with COVID-19 and was taken to the hospital in Ramle Prison. He can’t be vaccinated, because of his immunosuppressive disorder. He was returned to his cell earlier this week.

Amal will turn 18 next week. His current administrative detention is due to end in mid-May, though it might be extended again. His father, a Ramallah resident, is the head of the Wattan Media Network, which employs about 100 journalists. In the organization’s headquarters, high up in an office tower in the heart of the city, the staff was busy this week preparing a campaign supporting a one-state solution. In the past, the Israel Defense Forces raided the company’s offices and studios several times – most recently in 2012 – carrying off equipment that was never returned.

Muammar Nakhleh, 50, a journalist, lawyer and left-wing activist, has two children. Osama, now almost 19, was arrested for the first time at the age of 13 and spend two years of his life behind bars. Amal has now been incarcerated for a total of 14 months. Their parents are divorced, and the sons divide their time between their mother, Iman, in Jalazun, and their father, in Ramallah.

Amal was first arrested in November 2020, while he was on his way home from shopping in the new Palestinian city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah. He was held in custody for 40 days on suspicion of stone throwing, until military youth court judge Lt. Col. Sharon Keinan ordered his release on bail. The military prosecution appealed the decision, but meanwhile, on December, 10 another military court judge, Lt. Col. Yair Tirosh, dismissed the gravity of the classified evidence presented to him and also ordered Amal’s immediate release. On January 21, 2021, however, Amal was rearrested, with no explanation. A few days later, reserve military court judge Shimon Ashual approved the request – submitted by Col. Naama Rosen Grimberg, an intelligence officer in Central Command – to issue a six-month administrative detention order against Amal.

When Amal was 15, a benign tumor was discovered in his thymus gland, below the breastbone. A few months later, a Ramallah hospital recommended that he undergo surgery in Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem or in the city’s St. Joseph Hospital. His father was unable to obtain an entry permit to Israel for him, but Amal and his father succeeded in getting to the hospital by other means, and he underwent surgery there.

A few days after being released from the hospital Amal was arrested at the Atara checkpoint when leaving Rawabi. A few weeks after he was released, a Palestinian intelligence official called his father and told him to report to them urgently with his son. Muammar Nakhleh said he would produce his son the following day. Two hours later, Palestinian intelligence called again: “Where are you? Get here immediately. The Israelis are going to kidnap Amal.” Amal was then questioned by Palestinian investigators. He was asked about stone throwing at the Beit El settlement and about some of his Facebook posts, and was freed after an hour. That same night, Israeli troops arrested Amal at his mother’s home in Jalazun. Since January 21, 2021, he has been in prison.

Amal told his father that he was incarcerated because of his “biological thoughts.” Muammar says he meant his “ideological thoughts.” This week, in his Ramallah office, Muammar mentioned the confusion on his son’s part several times. “He is too childlike to be arrested for dangerous thoughts.”

Amal suffers from a rare autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis, which affects the connections between muscles and nerves, and can sometimes affect muscles used for breathing and also the limbs. The disease is connected to the tumor in the thymus gland for which Amal had surgery. It’s a chronic, incurable disease, and he requires medicative treatment and constant monitoring.

Dr. Bettina Birmans, a neurologist at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, examined Amal on June 14, 2021, in Ofer Prison, at the request of the family and the NGO Physicians for Human Rights. She reported that Amal complained of shortness of breath while walking, apparently due to his illness, and recommended an urgent CT scan, because, she wrote, “a considerable possibility exists that there is a malignant growth and precious time should not be wasted.” The scan was carried out on July 22, at Hadassah, and happily no evidence of tumor recurrence was found, as the radiologist, Prof. Dorit Shaham, wrote. According to Amal’s father, stressful situations are harmful to his son’s condition, and cause him to have trouble eating and breathing. His ocular muscles are also affected.

Joint List MKs Aida Touma-Sliman and Ofer Cassif tried to obtain Amal release, due to his condition, via Defense Minister Benny Gantz, and also attempted to ensure that he was receiving his medications. On September 22, 2021, Cassif sent a message to Gantz urging Amal’s release “in light of his medical condition and the danger to his health in conditions of incarceration.” To no avail. His parents worried that he’d contract the coronavirus since he is unvaccinated, and are concerned in general that the tumor will recur. When he indeed fell ill with the virus and was hospitalized in the Ramle Prison, MK Touma-Sliman inquired about his condition in the defense minister’s bureau, as Amal’s parents had no way to communicate with him; she was told he was in good condition. Amal, it bears noting, is still a minor, until next week.

There’s no way of knowing whether he will be released when his current, fourth term of administrative detention ends on May 18. Requests for his release by Palestinian and international human rights groups have also been rejected. “We are holding him for security reasons,” was the response they got. Every attempt to find out what security dangers justify such a lengthy, arbitrary detention, why this high-schooler is not being placed on trial if he is so dangerous, and what will become of these dangers when he is released one day – all these questions have gone unanswered. Indeed queries like those never get a response in cases of administrative detention, even when minors are involved.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit this week responded to Haaretz’s query on the subject as follows: “Amal Nakhleh was arrested by the security forces on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activity. After information was collected about him which showed involvement in military activities, dealings with weapons and participation in public terror activities, an order for his administrative detention was issued that was extended from time to time in light of his danger to the region’s security. The present detention order is valid until May 2022. All the orders, including the present one, were examined and authorized by the military court.

“In the deliberations relating to the judicial review of administrative detention, the court examines all the pertinent data in the matter, including every medical document presented to it, and weighs medical and other circumstances within the framework of its decision. We cannot comment on the data here, for reasons of personal privacy, and because the deliberations are held in camera.”

If the suspicions are indeed so grave, one must ask: Why has this young man not been put on trial?

Amal took his high-school matriculation exams in prison. He was supposed to enter university in the fall. At first, he wanted to study communications, but his father persuaded him to major in political science. “If you have something against him – tell us, tell his lawyer,” Muammar tells us. Iyad Hadad, a friend of the family and a field researcher for the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, adds, “Especially given his age and his medical condition.”

Amal – “hope” in Arabic – was so named when he was born preematurely, in the sixth month of pregnancy. The physicians told his parents that he wouldn’t survive but asked his father to give him a name nonetheless, for the death certificate they would issue. Muammar didn’t hesitate for a second, and named him Amal. Muammar, by the way, is named for Muammar Gadhafi, the former president of Libya; his brothers, too, have the names of Arab leaders.

Amal played on the Palestine children’s soccer team, and before his arrest was set to travel to South Korea with the team. His dream was to get to Barcelona; his hero is Lionel Messi. “His model is not his father or his mother, it’s Messi,” his father says.

Muammar admits that he is not optimistic about his son’s release in May, because when deciding on the last extension the authorities did not specify that it would be the last one. Last week the father was supposed to visit his son in prison, but the visit was canceled in the wake of Amal’s hospitalization with the coronavirus. During the year in which the young man has been imprisoned, Muammar has been permitted to visit him only twice.

On Sunday this week, Muammar met another youth from the Jalazun refugee camp who was incarcerated with Amal and was released. The teenager told him that Amal speaks to God and asks why he disappoints him time after time.

Lawyer Geoffrey Turyamusima, who represented Tumuhimbise and Pharidah in court, told VOA: “And the two charges, one is offensive communication and cyber stalking of the person of the president. They both pleaded not guilty, though they looked tortured.”

Tumuhimbise and Pharidah were arrested along with seven other journalists at the Digitalk offices last week by a joint security team comprising Ugandan army soldiers and police officers.

Other journalists on the scene were released on bond but also face charges of offensive communication.

Authorities have not commented on the allegations of torture.

Turyamusima says that based on his clients’ appearance in court, he will ask that a hearing be held on Monday to throw out the charges against Tumuhimbise and Pharidah.

In recent months, the Ugandan government has been accused of targeting writers seen as critical of the state — particularly writers who focus on President Yoweri Museveni and his family.

Tumuhimbise is a well-known critic of Museveni and his son, who is widely seen as a possible presidential successor.

In February, another author who criticized the president, Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, fled to Germany to seek treatment after allegedly being tortured for two weeks in a military facility.

The Minsk regional court sentenced Paval Vinahradau on March 16 after finding him guilty of spreading lies about the country's president online, inciting hatred, and organizing events that disrupted the social order.



Vinahradau has criticized Lukashenka's grip on power for years.

Lukashenka has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, when he won his first presidential election.



Vinahradau harshly criticized the 2020 presidential elections and a brutal crackdown launched by Lukashenka's regime on protesters, activists, independent media, and democratic institutions that followed the disputed presidential poll.



In 2010, Vinahradau was sentenced to four years in prison for taking part in public protests against the results of a presidential election that year, when Lukashenka was also declared the winner.



He was released in 2011 following a mass amnesty announced by Lukashenka.



Hundreds of Belarusians have faced trials linked to mass protests against Lukashenka over the results of the 2020 election, which they say was rigged.



Much of the opposition leadership has been jailed or forced into exile. Several protesters have been killed and there have also been credible reports of torture during the widening security crackdown."

The UK Supreme Court issued a one-line decision refusing to hear the WikiLeaks founder’s appeal against an earlier decision ordering his extradition to the United States.

The case will now be returned to the original court as a formality before being passed to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to give the final order. Once Patel receives the case, Assange could be on a plane to the US in just four weeks’ time, except for inevitable further appeals.

Julian Assange

The Biden administration intends to prosecute Assange for charges under the Espionage Act with a potential sentence of 175 years in prison. This would be served in barbaric conditions that previous judgements acknowledged could drive him to suicide. His health has already been destroyed by years of incarceration in Britain’s maximum security Belmarsh prison.

Despite the immense danger faced by the most significant journalist of the 21st century, many major newspapers did not cover the Supreme Court decision. Those that did ran entirely perfunctory stories, largely without comment.

Britain’s leading liberal newspaper, the Guardian, did not write a single critical line in its cursory 350-word article, quoting just two sentences from his legal team. The US New York Times managed, “If Mr. Assange were extradited to the United States and faced a trial, the case could raise profound First Amendment issues. His prosecution has alarmed advocates of press freedom.”

These are publications which have spent the last weeks screaming about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s censorship and attacks on free speech and journalistic freedoms. When speaking out about democratic rights lines up with imperialist war aims, they are fervent advocates. In the case of Assange, who exposed the systematic crimes of US and British imperialism, the “democratic principles” they so fiercely defend in Russia whither on the vine.

The NATO-Russia war over Ukraine has not only accelerated Assange’s persecution, but intensified his long and deliberate isolation by the corporate media.

At a briefing with the Foreign Press Association last month, to introduce his new book The Trial of Julian Assange: A Story of Persecution, UN special rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer accused the mainstream media of failing in their duty as the “fourth estate” to hold governments to account. Melzer’s book is based on his three years of efforts to end the illegal mistreatment of the WikiLeaks founder.

Professor Nils Melzer speaking at the Q&A to the Foreign Press Association (screenshot of YouTube video/Don't Extradite Assange Campaign)

In it, he criticises the “too little, too late”, “tame and lame” reporting of the British, American and American press, exposing their cynical pseudo-support for Assange:

“A handful of half-hearted opinion pieces in the Guardian and the New York Times rejecting Assange’s extradition are not bold enough, and so fail to convince. While both papers have timidly declared that convicting Assange of espionage would endanger press freedom, not a single mainstream media outlet protests the blatant violations of due process, human dignity and the rule of law that pervade the entire trial. None holds the involved governments to account for their crimes and corruption; none has the courage to confront political leaders with uncomfortable questions; none feels dutybound to inform and empower the people—a mere shadow of what was once the ‘fourth estate’.”

Amid the war frenzy and the need to present Britain and the US as champions of global democracy, even the days of the half-hearted opinion piece are over.

Melzer’s point extends far beyond the media. The UN rapporteur is one of just a handful of prominent public figures in any sphere with an honourable record on Assange. At his FPA event, he described his inability to seek redress “through the diplomatic channels at my disposal, or by alerting the General Assembly [of the UN] or the Human Rights Council in Geneva,” describing Assange as “the untouchable case,” kept behind a “wall of silence”.

Among the more significant silences is kept by the British “left”.

In July 2020, only 26 MPs could bring themselves to sign an early day motion, “Julian Assange, press freedom and public-interest journalism”, which asserted, “That this House notes the July 2020 statement by the National Union of Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and others in relation to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and affirms its commitment to press freedom and public-interest journalism.”

Among the signatories were 16 Labour MPs, including now former party leader Jeremy Corbyn and several of his shadow front benchers: John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Ian Lavery and Clive Lewis.

Of this rump, only one, Claudia Webbe, has spoken on Assange since the Supreme Court decision. Webbe is no longer a Labour MP, having been expelled from the party after a criminal harassment conviction. She tweeted simply, “Julian Assange should be free”.

The last time Corbyn, McDonnell, Abbott or Burgon, supposedly leading figures in the campaign for the WikiLeaks founder’s freedom, even tweeted on Assange was on January 24. Their support has always been for the record, motivated by a concern to preserve their “progressive” credentials. Under conditions of an escalating NATO war drive against Russia, to which they are all adapting, even nominal support is passing beyond the pale.

McDonnell and Abbott showed the direction of travel earlier this month, withdrawing their signatures from a Stop the War Coalition statement criticising NATO and backing out of the panel at its national rally in London. McDonell instead attended a pro-NATO rally alongside the imperialist shill Paul Mason.

He continued to make his political priorities clear on Monday, ignoring the Supreme Court ruling on Assange while tweeting the “incredibly courageous” anti-war protest of news editor Marina Ovsyannikova on Russia’s Channel 1. Ovsyannikova held up a sign during a live broadcast which read, “No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.”

A socialist might have commented that the same slogan sums up Assange’s beliefs, for which he is currently locked in a British prison and threatened with an effective death sentence, commending Ovsyannikova while exposing the hypocrisy of UK and US imperialism. They might also have noted that such a protest was never mounted on a British news channel during the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya or Syria, condemning the spineless conformity of the media.

But McDonnell, Corbyn and co are part of the same rotten milieu, committed to the sanctity of the state and its institutions, above all the Labour Party, now fulfilling its role as “the party of NATO” under Sir Keir Starmer. They can offer no serious opposition to British imperialism and its warmongering and therefore no defence of democratic rights, which will be increasingly curtailed as the war crisis and its domestic implications worsen.

Resistance to these measures will come from an independent movement of the working class. WikiLeaks and Assange won enormous popular sympathy among workers for their work 10 years ago. As the class struggle develops, pitching millions into fierce conflicts with their governments, that sentiment can be reawakened by a determined campaign in the working class to build a movement against war and for the freedom of Julian Assange."

It only made things worse because there was no room. At first, we were singing, but then we stopped even talking – we tried to save the air,” she said.

When the police van reached Brateevo police station, Russian National Guard officers escorted them to an assembly hall, made them sit down and took their passports. Detainees then heard, via loudspeakers, that the police station had enacted a special entry/exit regime that meant no one could enter – including legal personnel. This is a practice now employed regularly by Moscow police to isolate people detained at protests.

The police, both in uniform and plainclothes, refused to identify themselves, detainees said.

They then told detainees that their “rights had ended at the door”, and began their “psychological work”. This involved “inappropriate jokes”. “Boys with hair a little longer than usual were asked if they were girls; girls with short hair were bullied and called terrible names,” she remembers. For some reason, the police did not remove detainees’ phones, and they set up a group chat on Telegram.

‘The guy in the black turtleneck’

Anastasia was one of the first to be taken out of the assembly hall along with another woman. In an office on another floor, the police wanted to take photographs of the women, but they refused.

“Then they began to bring more in pairs. Someone refused to be photographed, and the police didn’t like it at all. [...] One of the police officers told us that he would ‘apply the law’ – that is, use force if we did not agree.”

With each refusal to be photographed, the police became more and more irritated and angry, the student says.

At some point, a “man in black” appeared in the corridor. All the detainees remember him. “A young man, 30 to 40 years old, athletic build, wearing a black turtleneck. And he had such a fashionable pistol holster, with straps going down both arms,” recalls Tatyana.

When Anastasia was returned to the assembly hall – after signing a police report accompanied by insults (“Why are you pretending to read, you can’t understand anything, you don’t have brains, stupid creature”) – she saw that other detained women had written in the group chat that “the man in black” had beaten and mocked them. Mediazona has seen the messages in question.

“I was hit twice when I was being questioned [﻿…﻿] But I feel rather normal; in terms of recording [the bruises] there is most likely nothing left,” one girl wrote.

“Right. Who hit you, the guy in a black turtleneck?” another answered.

“Yes. He also, I think, has a holster.”

“Yes Yes Yes. The **** detective.”

“That psycho swore at me, pulled off his mask and glasses, jumped, waved the chair in the air [and stopped right in front of my face], but I have no bruises. Just some kind of psycho,” a third woman added.

“Oh, he just threatened me with a chair. I said ‘Go on’ and he stopped talking, but then he started yelling again.”

‘He said: now you will all be deprived of your virginity’

When 20-year-old healthcare worker Yevgenia was taken to office #103, there were two women and two men there, all without COVID masks and wearing civilian clothes. One man, in a blue sweater, was smoking an electronic cigarette. The other, the same man in black as before, got a phone call and left the office.

The remaining policeman put Yevgenia on a chair and asked: “Will you [mess about] or will we talk normally?” She did not know how to answer and said: “Yes.” The policeman began to ask questions about where she lived and worked. Then he insulted her, demanded that she “not **** [lie],” and warned that if she was beaten, the police would face “nothing for it”.

A few minutes later, this threat was made real by the man in a black turtleneck, who returned to the office. He hovered over Yevgenia and demanded that she unlock her phone.

“The man started yelling: ‘And if I hit you in the mouth, where will you run?’ I just kept quiet. I said that I would not take out the phone, then he hit me three times on the shoulder with his hand. After that, leaning on a chair, he hit me with his knee,” she recalls.

Then the policeman forced the girl to stand up, took hold of her hands, and ordered his colleague (the one with an electronic cigarette) to get the phone out of her jeans pocket."

New York, June 30, 2021 – Syrian authorities should disclose their rationale for arresting journalist Bassam Safar, as well as the location where he is being held, or else release him immediately, the Committee to Protect Journalists said today.

On June 24, Syrian government security forces arrested Safar, an editor on cultural topics for the North Press Agency, a news website supportive of the Syrian Democratic Forces opposition group, when he arrived at the Bab Sharqi checkpoint in eastern Damascus en route to his home, according to news reports, a statement by the regional press freedom group Skeyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom, and statements by his employer and Syria’s banned opposition Communist Labor Party, of which Safar is a member.

Authorities have not disclosed the reason for his arrest or where he is being held, according to those sources. CPJ emailed the Syrian Interior Ministry for comment, but did not immediately receive any reply.

“Given the Syrian government’s record of arbitrary arrests, mistreatment, and torture of detainees, the recent arrest of journalist Bassam Safar is particularly worrying,” said CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa representative, Ignacio Miguel Delgado. “Syrian authorities must immediately disclose their reasons for his arrest, or release Safar unconditionally at once.”

The North Press Agency and Communist Labor Party reports state that, earlier in June, authorities held Safar for two days after he returned to Damascus from the city of Qamishli, but did not state any reason for that detention.

Safar was imprisoned from 1986 and 1991 because of his affiliation with the Communist Labor Party, according to those reports.

According to those news reports, Safar had recently met with officials from the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change, a leftist opposition umbrella group of which he is a member of the executive committee, to discuss the country’s presidential elections.

President Bashar al-Assad won a fourth term in those elections in May, which international observers condemned as fraudulent, with 95 percent of the vote, according to reports.

Safar’s recent work at the North Press Agency includes a series of interviews with human rights lawyers about documenting abuses in the country, activist Fadwa Mahmoud about her alleged abuse in government detention, and exiled author and human rights activist Mozn Murshid."

The report, by the Coalition Against SLAPPs in Europe (CASE), notes how the shock of Caruana Galizia’s assassination led to increased international attention to Malta, which resulted in some amendments to the laws on defamation and press freedom.

RELATED STORIES Editorial: Journalists need SLAPP protection

“Nonetheless, the culture of filing legal complaints to silence criticism is still prevalent in Malta. At the start of 2022, three defamation cases were filed by public officials against newsrooms and journalists.”

SLAPPs, which are on the increase in Europe, abuse existing laws to intimidate and harass those who speak out and actively participate in the civil space, according to CASE.

SLAPPs do not necessarily have to be filed in the country of the defendant: in 2020, legal proceedings in Bulgaria were directed at Times of Malta, and separately at blogger Manuel Delia. These were not included in CASE's sample.

Highest number of SLAPPs per capita

CASE noted that its study is not an exhaustive survey of SLAPP cases across the continent. Data was gathered through desk research, interviews, and snowball sampling, providing ""only a snapshot of the issue of SLAPPs in Europe"".

The study surveyed 570 legal cases that qualified as SLAPPs which were filed between 2010 and 2021 in 29 European jurisdictions. Of these, 35 were filed against Caruana Galizia, followed by 19 against Polish publisher Agora SA.

A further four were filed against Caruana Galizia’s son Matthew, one against ex-PN leader Simon Busuttil, one against Julian Bonnici of LovinMalta and the 42nd one against independent electoral candidate Arnold Cassola.

Malta’s 42 SLAPPs put the island at the top of the list for the highest number of cases per capita. According to CASE, this means eight cases were filed for every 100,000 people, followed by 1.95 per 100,000 for Slovenia and 1.22 for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Silvio Debono, Adrian Delia file high number of SLAPPs

The top plaintiff flagged by the study was Slovenian Rok Snezic (39 SLAPPs), followed by Maltese business mogul Silvio Debono who filed 19.

Former PN leader Adrian Delia also made it among the top SLAPPers, with five cases to his name.

Last year the DB Group owner and the Caruana Galizia family reached a settlement that effectively ended the 19 libel suits which the businessman had filed against the journalist four years before.

Most withdrawn SLAPPs

Another 14 SLAPP suits in Malta were withdrawn. This was the highest number of withdrawn suits in Europe. Malta was followed by France (seven) and Poland and Italy (three each).

According to CASE, only one case was dismissed while another one was won by the complainant in Malta. In contrast, 14 were won by the complainant in Poland.

Now it’s a region scarred by decades of war.





He was born in the district of North Waziristan, on the border with Afghanistan, after the USSR’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. Kashef, now 28, describes his childhood as being quite normal, growing up like generations of Indigenous Pashtuns before him.

Ethnic Pashtuns make up roughly 15 per cent of Pakistan’s population of about 238 million, with many also living across the border in Afghanistan. The fiercely independent tribal group is traditionally governed by Pashtunwali, an unwritten customary law passed down by respected elders for centuries.

But Kashef says his life changed when the United States invaded Afghanistan after 9/11.

He says the US attack created a huge influx of refugees across the border.

“We lived in the borderland, so we would hear the bombardment and the noise. I was in grade two or three around that time,” he tells SBS Dateline.

After the Taliban government was toppled in 2001, Kashef says many fighters took refuge in his area. He says they share the same ethnicity, so it was easy for them to cross the border and integrate.

“The language is the same, the origin is the same, same bloodlines and everything. It makes sense that it was so easy,” he says.

But Kashef says the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islam was at odds with the customary laws administered by tribal elders.

“They became a dominant part of society. Around 1,500 elders were murdered. The Taliban were trying to become the authority.”

Kashef says everyone from his village was terrorised, regularly reminded of the consequences of speaking out.

“We would always see mutilated bodies on our way to school. They were usually the elders of certain tribes.”

At this point he apologises for becoming agitated, seeming to recognise his anger building.

“For a small kid, this influences your mind,” he says. “It influenced a lot of us. Some of us were radicalised to join them and carry out suicide attacks.

Kashef was eventually accepted to study economics in the Pakistan capital Islamabad, while Pakistan’s military carried out a major offensive against the Taliban, aimed at pushing them out of the tribal areas. His parents became internally displaced people as a result of the violence.

When it was safe to return at the end of 2017, Kashef and his family found his town in ruins.

“Everything was destroyed. Even my house. Everything was finished,” he says.

It was at this time that a movement founded by a group of students including a veterinary science student named Manzoor Pashteen was starting to gain traction.

“Things were changing. The way of thinking was changing,” Kashef says.

Rise of the PTM

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement was born out of what Kashef describes as longstanding discrimination against Pashtuns in Pakistan, as a result of their different language and complexion. The movement gained a huge following in 2018, after the staged killing of aspiring model Naqeebullah Mehsud by a senior superintendent of police in Karachi.

Kashef says Pashtuns were the victims of the government’s military campaign against the Taliban.

“[The PTM] is totally nonviolent. We were demanding constitutional and human rights.”

The movement regularly holds 'jalsas' or public demonstrations and sit-ins across the country.

Bilquees Daud from the Centre for Afghanistan Studies at India’s Jindal Global University, agrees that the movement pursues a policy of nonviolence.

“The nonviolent legacy among Pashtuns started with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as the frontier Gandhi,” Ms Daud says. “His legacy has deliberately been removed from the history of Pashtuns.”

According to Ms Daud, the PTM has three main objectives: the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate extrajudicial killings; securing the release of missing people or information as to their whereabouts; and the removal of landmines from Pashtun tribal areas. Authorities claim to have cleared at least 48,000 landmines in the region.

Dr Ayesha Jehangir, from the UTS Centre for Media Transition, is a former war journalist from the region, and says the movement wants to “demilitarise the Pashtun youth.”

“War is embedded in Pashtun culture, not violence, I want to make that distinction clear,” Dr Jehangir tells SBS Dateline. “This culture of war goes back well past the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.”

“Pashtuns are an Indigenous ethnicity in Pakistan and one of the most underrepresented, oppressed and marginalised in terms of education, health and political representation,” Dr Jehangir says.

She says the PTM’s protests in favour of rights for Pashtuns have been wrongly labelled by the government as anti-state, terrorist activities.

“To date there has not been a single attack by the PTM, neither has any member of the PTM ever been involved in any terrorist activities,” she says.

Allegations of state persecution

As a result of these alleged terrorist activities, Dr Jehangir says Pakistani media outlets face huge challenges when reporting on the PTM.

“The reason the media is instructed not to cover the PTM is because it talks about the missing Pashtun people, it talks about the military operations in northern Pakistan.”

Batoor* is a former journalist who became supportive of the PTM. He also talks of the “establishment” warning media outlets not to report on PTM rallies.

“In 2020, there was a big PTM gathering in Swat, and there were no TV or newspaper reporters covering that. My friend tried to report it, but he received a penalty for covering the rally,” Batoor says.

He decided to leave journalism to pursue another profession, but he came under more pressure from the government for his links with the PTM.

He has received numerous desist letters from the authorities, which he says is common for members of the PTM.

Letters like this are commonly sent to members of the PTM Source: Supplied

“When someone from the PTM speaks, they are speaking truths that the government doesn’t want to be made public. They say the government supports the Taliban in order to push the US back,” Batoor says.

SBS Dateline had organised an interview with PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen. However on Thursday, reports emerged of an attack on Mr Pashteen and the vehicle convoy he was travelling in. Regional PTM coordinator Noor Bachar, who was travelling with the group, is understood to have been shot, while Mr Pashteen escaped injury.

The Taliban’s return to power

While people like Batoor fear the government’s alleged censorship and oppression of the PTM, the Taliban’s victory and consolidation of power in Afghanistan is quickly becoming another major threat.

“PTM supporters are extremely worried about the Taliban coming back. They will kill all the PTM supporters first,” he says.

""You have to put everything aside. You must accept that they could kill you, they could behead you. If you can do all of these things, you can be part of the PTM. Otherwise it is too dangerous.""

Dr Jehangir also sees the potential for conflict between the PTM and the Taliban in the borderland.

“The PTM is anti-war and pro-education. The Taliban is pro-war and anti-education. How can these two exist together?”

Talks are continuing in Norway between the Taliban and Western diplomats, with the issue of

reported to be high on the agenda.

Bilquees Daud describes the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as the beginning of an “era of radicalisation” when fighters from around the Islamic world formed the mujahideen in opposition to the USSR-aligned government.

You have to put everything aside. You must accept that they could kill you, they could behead you. If you can do all of these things, you can be part of the PTM. Otherwise it is too dangerous. - Batoor

“The era of radicalisation really changed village life for Pashtuns,” Ms Daud says.

“Pashtunwali was banned and replaced by Sharia law. Pashtun women never wore the burqa. That was all changed by the mujahideen and the Taliban. The way the Taliban beat women in the streets was totally unimaginable in Pashtun society.”

Ms Daud has observed commentary linking the Taliban and Pashtun nationalism, which she says is incorrect.

“Pashtuns are not just the Taliban. They are also people like [PTM founder] Manzoor Pashteen,” she says.

Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine at 4 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 24. I did not catch the moment. I was in the hospital, a week after a total knee replacement surgery, still in pain and on sleeping pills.

My surgeon, himself half Ukraine, walked into my room: ""The war has begun,"" he said and sobbed. ""My friends, my relatives — what will happen to them …""

I felt sorry for him, but my brain was rolling crazy: Did my news people catch the news? Who should I ask to write an analysis right away?

'Ministry of Truth'

I was terrified by the news but not surprised. I was aware that Putin was to start a war sooner or later. I think it became pretty apparent after he amended the Russian Constitution in the spring of 2020, making himself president for life.

An external enemy, a threat capable of uniting the nation under the well-known Soviet wartime slogan ""Fatherland is in danger!' was in his sick mind a precondition for a successful transfer of his presidency into dictatorship, or even a monarchy with divine origin and powers. The validity of which no one was to question or to challenge.

My New Times was running the news, the op-eds came even when I was still asleep, and I went on air live with events and analysis on my YouTube channel right from my hospital ward.

I asked to be released home the next day.

On Feb. 26, I got a letter from the Russian agency in charge of censorship. It officially is the Federal Service for Supervision in the Field of Communications, but we call it the Ministry of Truth. The letter said that New Times' stories (as well as those by nine other outlets) about the ""shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians"" were ""untrue information.""

In fact, according to the agency, use of the words ""war,"" ""invasion"" and ""offense"" concerning events in Ukraine were out of the question. The bombardment of Ukrainian cities with missiles must be called a ""special operation.""

On Feb. 28, the New Times site was blocked on the territory of the Russian Federation. OK, we said, our readers inside the country are to use the VPN (virtual private network), which allows pretending that your phone or laptop is located in, say, Sweden or the United States. We were facing charges, fines and a court hearing. But all that was part of being an independent media in an authoritarian country. I was not concerned.

My father's safe house

A much more terrifying thought was that my nation, Russia, where I was born and of which I am a citizen, had started a war of conquest.

At 8 p.m. that day, I had my regular talk show at freewheeling Echo Moskvy broadcasting, as I had each Monday for 19 consecutive years. A reporter working in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, a military expert and a political scientist were scheduled to be my guests.

I started with a story about the southern Ukrainian city of Nikolaev (Mykolaiv), which was already under the offense of the Russian troops. Video footage from Nikolaev suggested heavy shelling; vehicles were on fire, glass in apartment building windows was broken, sidewalks were riddled with bullets.

I knew the city. I was there a couple of years ago because of my father's story. Mark Albats parachuted into the territory of Nazi-occupied Ukraine in September 1941. His safe house, where he kept a radio transmitter, was on 14 Pushkinskaya Street in Nikolaev. I immediately recognized the city and the street when I saw the footage.

My dad fought the Nazis to defend his motherland, Russia, then part of the USSR. Thanks to G-d, my father is long gone to a better world, and he did not get to see that now Russia is attacking Ukraine and making ruins out of Nikolaev as Nazis did eight decades ago during World War II.

Smothered free press, in just a week

The show went well. I did not know it was my last show. Three days later, on March 3, Echo Moskvy was taken off the air. The next day, just last Friday, the only independent TV channel, Dozd (TV Rain), at which I was a frequent political commentator, was also shut down.

Well, I told myself, the situation was not lovely, but after all, I lived in the totalitarian Soviet Union. I was a student at Moscow University's Department of Journalism when the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan. Things went from bad to worse for those not loyal to the communist party and the KGB.

I survived then. Sure enough, I will survive now, as YouTube is running, my channel is getting an audience and Google is placing ads.

Little did I know.

On Friday, Russian State Duma passed three new repressive laws. Any information about the war in Ukraine that does not fit the narrative of the Russian Ministry of Defense is to be considered fake news and punishable for up to 15 years in jail.

It prompted whatever nonstate media left to shut down their websites or publicly announce that their news department is closed from now on. It is to say that they will not cover the war in Ukraine anymore. In a matter of a single week, independent media ceased to exist in Russia.

Hundreds if not thousands of professionals left Russia — the best editors, reporters, filmmakers, analysts, professors of economy and political science. Business people with cash handy flew to Dubai and Arab Emirates. Those with modest means choose Central Asia.

My young reporter wrote to me that she was ""urgently getting married"" because she did not want to be alone in exile. She did not have enough savings for a ticket to Yerevan (capital of Armenia). So she ended up looking for one to Uzbekistan. I hope she will get there in one piece with her loved one.

As for me, I am planning to do a show on my YouTube channel.

Several days ago, I was awakened at 3 a.m. by a friend: ""Be ready, they (i.e., police or FSB) will come to arrest you around 6-7 a.m.""

I took a shower, got dressed, put a new bandage on my knee, packed a bag with essentials and went back to sleep.

They did not come. But I keep the bag by the door.

Polls in dictatorships

You may ask — as I ask myself: Why did Putin and his supporters decide to kill all independent media in Russia? After all, we were just leftovers — a small liberal ghetto amid the rich and powerful state media, which control every TV network capable of covering the country of 11 time zones.

If you read the polls conducted by the two state-owned pollsters, their numbers suggest that Putin and his war have the support of two-thirds of those polled. Yet, polls in dictatorships bear no value — people are afraid to say what they really think.

Are there people who support the war? Oh yes, one can see cars with the letter Z chosen as a recognition sign for the Russian military vehicles in Ukraine drawn on the side doors of the expensive SUVs driving through Moscow.

Yet, it is also true that more than 13,500 predominantly young people got arrested, and face 15 to 30 days in jail, for anti-war protests, which erupt daily in many cities across Russia.

After the first days of the war, the Kremlin realized that independent news coverage attracted millions of Russians looking for information beyond the propaganda machine. In 2008, during a short war against Georgia, the Kremlin lost an information war to the liberal Russian media.

This time, Putin chose not to take chances. He signed a death order for the media that had the courage to tell the truth of the war of his making.

All that is left are his Kremlin media — TV channels and radio stations.

This year, like all the years before, on the anniversary of the start of World War II in the Soviet Union, they'll broadcast one of the most famous songs of the war, which begins:

""On June 22d, At exactly four o'clock Kyiv was bombed, We were told that the war had begun.""

As I write those words, Kyiv is under siege by Russian troops."

But that is not saying much. Last Sunday her words were jumbled, her voice on edge. She said she had not slept. That she could not eat or keep food down. That she had had thoughts of self-harm.

“I was on a plane yesterday and I said to my brother, ‘Can you feel me sitting next to me?’ And he said, ‘Have you completely lost it?’ And I said, ‘No, I’m just not sure I’m sitting next to you. I feel like I’m in a dream.’ And afterwards, I spoke to my psychiatrist and she said, ‘You’re dissociating. You’ve had a traumatic experience –that’s your brain shutting down.’”

In fact, this is a highly rational response to what Ayyub is going through. In a crowded field, she may well be the most hated journalist on Earth.

As an investigative journalist, she had been a thorn in the side of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his allies for more than a decade. And as a commentator with a column in the Washington Post, she had repeatedly embarrassed him and his government on the international stage.

But the attacks and abuse she has suffered for years reached a crisis last week. A crisis that mirrors what is happening in India itself. As a journalist, Ayyub has been repeatedly warning that the Modi government’s hostility to Muslims will tip into violence. And as a Muslim journalist, she knows it already has. She is not just reporting on India’s dangerous slide into authoritarianism and violent extremism, she is living it. In the past few weeks she has had police charges filed against her in multiple states and been subjected to a vicious propaganda campaign accompanied by horrific online abuse.

She was calmer when I spoke to her last Wednesday, partly because the United Nations had issued a statement in support of her, citing her “judicial harassment” and “misogynistic and sectarian” targeting.

“The worse thing is the lack of journalistic solidarity,” she had told me last Sunday, though international organisations such as Reporters Without Borders and Index on Censorship had stepped up for her.

But it is happening in the context of crucial elections in five states and hate speech, with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) using inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims in official communications.

Last month the director of the campaign group Genocide Watch, Gregory Stanton, said that he believed “a genocide could very well happen in India”. His voice joined others such as that of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and drew an explicit link to the experience of living in Rwanda, which had led him to found his organisation. In 1989 he had told Rwanda’s then president that “if you don’t do something to prevent genocide in your country, there is going to be a genocide within five years.”

Five years later there was a genocide in Rwanda. The same conditions, he said, are in place in India today and that genocide is not an “event” but a “process” – a process that includes extreme polarisation and a government that is daily inciting violence against a minority.

It is Ayyub’s continuing daily stress of reporting on this over years – beginning with an undercover investigation in Modi’s home state of Gujarat in 2011 that implicated him and his allies in the massacre of more than 1,000 Muslims in 2002 – that is the background to her latest crisis.

It is a crisis that has seen the Indian authorities open a corruption investigation into her that has included freezing her bank accounts and led last week to two UN special rapporteurs making a statement in her defence.

“The lack of condemnation and proper investigation by the government, coupled with the legal harassment it has itself inflicted on Ms Ayyub has only served to falsely legitimise the attacks and attackers and further endangered her safety,” it said.

And that is not even the worst of Ayyub’s troubles. “I was in Delhi to meet my lawyers to discuss the case and I went on the BBC to discuss the hijab ban in India and Muslim women not being allowed in educational institutions to study. That’s a new thing that’s never happened before.” A video of a young Muslim girl wearing a hijab being hounded by a mob of men had gone viral and on the BBC Ayyub “called them rightwing terrorists. Because these are people who are terrorising a woman”.

The interview led to new charges against her in five states. She has been accused of “sedition” and “defaming the Hindu community”. And last Sunday, as her grandmother lay dying, she was unable to travel to her home state of Uttar Pradesh to be with her because she feared arrest.

What is happening to Ayyub is so extreme, and so complex in the way her harassment by the Indian authorities is intimately entwined with her harassment on social media. Hindu activists used Twitter and Facebook to appeal for more people to come forward and file cases against her.

“And the day that started, ‘Arrest Rana Ayyub’ trended for 48 hours,” she said. The International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and Sheffield University computer scientists are monitoring and analysing the threats against Ayyub in real time and they see a shocking story of online violence in the data.

On the same day I contacted Ayyub to check that she was OK, Julie Posetti, the global director of research at the ICFJ, messaged me to say that its monitoring had shown that “the threats against her are escalating badly. I’m really worried she’s going to be killed by an IRL [in real life] virtual lynch mob.”

This is far from a frivolous fear. In 2017, Ayyub’s good friend, fellow journalist Gauri Lankesh, was gunned down by Hindu extremists. “I had put out a Facebook post about how I was disillusioned with what was happening and the way people were treating me on Twitter and she wrote on my Facebook saying, ‘Babe, they are paper tigers. Don’t get intimidated.’ The next day, she was shot dead outside her house.”

What is striking about Ayyub is the way she is able to articulate all this. Even in the midst of her torment, she is able to express her horror and relate it to the wider issue of what is happening in India. She, too, fears that she is witnessing the early stages of a genocide.

“The day before yesterday, the BJP’s Twitter handle, its Instagram handle, put a caricature of Muslim men hanging from a noose,” she said.

The world is not paying attention to what is happening in India. Ayyub is scathing about social media companies’ failure to take action, especially Facebook, a primary mode of communication across a country of 1.4 billion people. An explosive article in the Wall Street Journal had revealed that one of the company’s most senior executives in the country had herself posted anti-Muslim hate material.

Genocide Watch’s Stanton makes the connection between Myanmar and the Rohingya and the Indian government’s treatment of the Kashmiris, who have been subjected to extreme measures and denial of their basic rights in the almost entirely Muslim state. In Myanmar, the UN said Facebook was a crucial tool that the government used to incite violence – exactly what is also happening in India right now. “They took down the BJP’s post. But they should have removed the account,” said Ayyub.

The worst thing, perhaps, is that Ayyub believes she is fortunate compared with other journalists in India, a country that has slipped to 142 out of 180 for press freedom, according to Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index. Her column in the Washington Post has afforded her an international audience, and last Sunday the newspaper put out a full-page advert in support of her, saying the free press in India is under attack. Other journalists are in jail or hiding.

But it is still too much for her. That was what was abundantly clear in my two calls last week. “I feel like a child again,” said Ayyub. Her mother had travelled to be with her grandmother as she lay dying, but before she had gone, said Ayyub, “I actually became a child. I asked her to sleep next to me.”"
44,https://allafrica.com/stories/202202240468.html,Ghana : Is Free Speech a Crime in President Akufo - Addo Ghana ? ,24/02/2022,Nigeria,f09cf6e5-d456-108b-2ebe-4a3f13a8716f,"Journalists and civil society activists who speak their minds about public figures and the government are being hauled off to court in Ghana. This recent spate of arrests and prosecutions has many worried.

Since the start of the year, at least three journalists and one prominent social activist have been prosecuted in Ghana for what authorities deemed are unfounded statements..

These developments have many in the West African country worried that the freedom of speech, a right guaranteed under Ghana's 1992 Constitution, is being curtailed.

On February 10, Accra FM radio presenter Kwabena Bobie Ansah was charged with the ""publication of false news and offensive conduct."" Police had detained him after he stated that the First Lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo had fraudulently obtained state land for private use. The case is still pending.

Days earlier, another TV and radio presenter who had been picked up by police after criticizing the government on air appeared in court. Blessed Godsbrain Smart, who works for Media General TV, was initially accused of making ""unsavory"" comments but prosecutors later changed the charge to one of extortion.

Oheneba Boamah Bennie, a host and commentator for the privately-owned Power FM in Accra, was this month sentenced to two weeks in prison and fined 3,000 Ghana cedis ($468) for contempt of court. The case brought against him centered around a video posted on his Facebook page in 2021. In the video, Bennie alleged in the video that President Nana Akufo-Addo had conspired with judges to influence Ghana's 2020 elections.

The trend is being watched

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) condemned the conviction of Oheneba Boamah Bennie.

""Journalists should not be jailed in connection with their reporting or commentary about public figures, whom one would hope would have a thicker skin when it comes to criticism,"" a CPJ statement read.

A few days after Bennie was sentenced, police arrested a promnent social activist and leader of Ghana's FixTheCountry youth pressure group on charges of treason. Oliver Barker-Vormawor had warned on his Facebook page of a coup in the event that Parliament passes a controversial electronic levy bill.

He was arraigned in court on February 14 and remains in detention.

In defending the arrest of the journalists, police argue that they are simply discharging their duties. Lawmaker and former journalist Alhassan Suhuyini says he is worried about the emerging trend.

""Many journalists have suffered one of form of harassment or another at the hands of people claiming to be acting in the name of the state. There was a reason why the criminal libel law was repealed and it is an irony that the current president has over the years taken pride in the role that he played in repealing the criminal libel law,"" Suhuyini told reporters in Accra.

President Akufo-Addo had pushed for the repeal of the criminal libel and seditious libel laws in Ghana when he was still an activist. The law was fraught with the dangers. It left prosecutions up to a party-aligned attorney-general who served at the pleasure of the president. It was eventually repealed in 2001,giving respite to the media and the public respite.

Ghana's 1992 Constitution states: ""All persons shall have the right to -- (a) freedom of speech and expression, which shall include freedom of the press and other media."" The provision was significant, considering the criminalization of speech under past military regimes with journalists and political opponents of the ruling class suffering the most.

.

A 'resurrection' of criminal libel?

Cvil society groups have detected a shift amid the spate of court cases involving journalists..The Ghana Center for Democratic Development, IMANI Africa and Africa Center for International Law & Accountability outlined theirs in a joint statement.

""The underlisted Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) note with deep concern the apparent resurrection of the discredited criminal libel regime through a series of recent arrests and prosecution of persons for statements made or published in the media,"" the organizations said.

""We are deeply troubled by the growing use of the prosecutorial and judicial power of the State to punish criminally speech that allegedly falsely injures or damages the reputation of other persons or of an institution of state.""

In the 1990s, the organizations added, ""the criminal law was used in precisely the way it is now being used: to prosecute and punish journalists and public speakers for allegedly false or defamatory statements against certain family members or associates of the President.""

Ruling party lawmaker Alexander Afenyo Markin denied that the state is coming after outspoken journalists or trying to curtail free speech. In parliament he said journalists should be cautious in discharging their work in order to avoid such treatments.

""We have a lot of bloggers, the kind of misrepresentation and all that, should be of concern to all of us, Let's encourage them to be vibrant, to report, to write the news but to be very objective in the way they do their thing.""

Media urged to tone down rhetoric

Tanko Zakariah, a media ethics lecturer at the Ghana Institute of Journalism in Accra told DW that what should not be ignored is the responsibility that comes with freedom of speech.

""Freedom and independence of the media and freedom of speech is a constitutional guarantee in line with international standards. But clearly in those laws it does say that those freedoms come without some sort of responsibilities. In other words, they are not absolute freedoms, they come with some qualifications."" Zakariah explained.

""People have to be responsible when exercising their rights because that same rights they are exercising, others have also been given their fundamental human rights.""

The three civil society groups that expressed their concerns about curtailed free speech also offered advice to journalists.

""We also urge media practitioners and users to tone down the inflammatory rhetoric that has contaminated our public square and airwaves, desist from knowingly or recklessly making or publishing false statements, and use, to the extent possible, the Right to Information Act and its processes to access information from public authorities.""

Several of Ghana's political and legal analysts see the situation as one that pertains not only to freedom of speech.

In a recent media discussion, laywer Kofi Bentil said he sees a threat to democracy in a country with a ruling political class that he believes is becoming intolerant.

""There is something I call the downward political spiral and this downward political spiral, across regimes, you see it. I think that our friends in power should be wary of this phenomenon. You have a situation where somebody makes a post and you understand what he is talking about and you drop on him, you detain him, you start arresting journalists all over the place,"" he said.

Police told to produce him before the court by Feb. 19

A J&K court issued an arrest warrant against journalist Gowhar Nazir Geelani on Thursday. An executive magistrate directed the Station House Officer (SHO), Heepora, Shopian, in south Kashmir, to produce Mr. Geelani before the court by February 19. “In view of non-appearance of Gowhar Nazir Geelani after serving notice on him under Section 107/151 CRPF, dated February 03, 2022, you are directed to arrest and produce the person before this court on Feb 19, 2022, in order to maintain peace and public tranquillity in the jurisdiction of this court,” an order issued by the executive magistrate said. Mr. Geelani, who writes for foreign news channels and portals and is a well-known television commentator, was first summoned by the court on February 1 over “dissemination of information on social media that would have endangered the life of the injured individual and other persons”, following a militant attack that left a policeman injured.

Officials said Mr. Geelani has failed to present himself before the court in response to the summon so far. Mr. Geelani would be the third journalist to be arrested in the past two months in Kashmir. Earlier, Sajad Gul, a photojournalist, and Fahad Shah, editor of the ‘Kashmir Walla’, were arrested. Mr. Gul was arrested under the Public Safety Act, that allows a person to be detained for two years without a trial. Mr. Shah was booked under sections of the law related to sedition and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and is at present in police remand. The journalists’ arrests and summons to Mr. Geelani have already evoked sharp criticism from several journalist bodies in and outside the country. Around 59 press freedom organisations, human rights groups and publications wrote to J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on February 14 “to secure the immediate release of Kashmiri journalist Fahad Shah and the withdrawal of all police investigations launched into his journalistic work”."

Yet, the return of warm ties between the two countries seems to be stronger than ever, more evidently in the recent arrest of a Qatar-based Yemeni critic of Saudi Arabia.

According to the Lebanese pro-Iran Al Mayadeen TV channel, Yemeni commentator Saleh Al Jarmouzi was arrested by Qatari authorities in Doha shortly after he appeared on the channel and expressed criticism of the ongoing Saudi military operations in Yemen.

Ameen Al-Jermozi says Qatari authorities have arrested Doha-based Saleh Al-Jermozi after his interview with Al-Mayadeen TV speaking on Saada prison attack. This arrest hangs a question marks over if Qatar is back to the Saudi-led coalition after reconciliation with Saudi Arabia?! https://t.co/tZg6QG9CBr — Naseh Shaker (@Naseh_Shaker) February 7, 2022

In his TV appearance, Saleh Al Jarmouzi had also weighed on statements made by Al-Azhar religious institution, often regarded as the biggest amongst Sunni Islamic ones, in which Houthi attacks on the UAE killing three residents were quickly condemned, but not the Saudi or the Emirati airstrikes against civilian targets in Yemen, killing dozens of people since 2015.

Online people quickly shared the news shared by Al Mayadeen TV amid confirmations from his family, while they questioned the unusual Qatari action against critics of Saudi Arabia.

Many people noted that the Qatar-based Aljazeera has always hosted Yemeni activists and politicians who were either expressing anti-Saudi stances or pro-Houthi ones, with none of them facing arrest.

Social media users also condemned the arrest saying that it was a sign of deteriorating freedom of speech in Qatar as it also suggests stronger ties between Saudi Arabia and Qatar."

SRINAGAR: Fahad Shah, editor and owner of news portal The Kashmir Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir police on Friday for his publishing 'anti-national' content which, it said, could also instigate people for violence.

Shah had while speaking to this newspaper earlier this week denied the allegation and asserted that he was discharging his responsibility as an independent journalist for which he had been summoned to police stations several times in the past.

A statement issued by the police here on Friday evening said that some Facebook users and portals have been uploading anti-national content including photographs, videos and posts with criminal intention to create fear among public and could also provoke the public to disturb law and order.

""It was also learnt that these Facebook users are uploading such posts which tantamount to glorifying the terrorist activities and causing dent to the image of law enforcing agencies besides causing ill-will and disaffection against the country"" , the statement read.

It said that the police in southern Pulwama district took cognizance of these activities and registered an FIR under relevant sections of the law and initiated the investigation. It further said that during the course of investigation, one of the accused person Shah was arrested and was now on police remand.

Earlier on Monday, Shah and three others journalists were summoned to a police station in Pulwama over propagation of statements of a local family claiming that one of its young members killed in a gunfight a day ago was not a militant.

The police and Army officials had said on Sunday that one of the four Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) militants killed in a gunfight with security forces in Pulwama’s Naira village was Inayat Ahmed, the son of the owner of a private house where the clash took place.

They had also said that while taking on the hiding militants Ahmed was asked to surrender “but he along with other terrorists opened fire at the security forces and got killed”. Inspector General of Police, Vijay Kumar, had said that Ahmed was a “hybrid terrorist.” He had also said that the house-owner was being booked under the relevant sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 for providing shelter to militants.

The family had refuted the police claim and insisted on Ahmed not being a militant or associated with JeM or any other militant outfit. A video in which his sister pleads his innocence went viral on social media on Monday itself.

Late on that evening, the Pulwama police issued summons to Shah, another prominent journalist and political commentator Majid Hyderi and two local reporters in connection with the case registered under Sections 307 IPC and 7/25 IA Act and Sections 16, 18,20 and 38 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 following the gunfight at Naira.

The police sources had said that the journalists were summoned to the police station for their “incorrect reporting” of the clash. They said that the summons were issued by the area Station House Officer under section 160 of the CrPC which empowers a police officer investigating a case to require attendance of witnesses. The summons read, “It appears that you are acquainted with the circumstances of FIR and your presence is necessary to give such information as you may possess relating to FIR for the finalization of the investigation and arrest of the accused person.”

Shah had told this newspaper that The Kashmir Walla had published stories on the encounter as well as the statements of the police and the family on it and had also reported on the viral video of the slain youth’s sister. He had said that he would visit the police station on Wednesday.

Hyderi had said that he reported to the police station earlier during the day on Monday where he was asked about his sharing the girl’s video on social media. “I told the officer that we are journalists of a conflict zone stuck between the devil and the deep sea and as such have to report and share varied versions of a story,” he had said."

States of emergency (article 4)

The Cambodian government used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to further clamp down on civil and political rights as enshrined in the Covenant. In the guise of alleged measures to combat the pandemic, the government adopted the draconian Law on the Management of the Nation in a State of Emergency (hereinafter “the State of Emergency Law”).[1] The State of Emergency Law empowers Prime Minister Hun Sen with sweeping and undefined powers without necessary checks and balances or procedural safeguards. Similar to the adoption process of other rights-restricting legislation, the government did not openly and widely consult civil society and other stakeholders affected by the law or who have expertise on the issue. The government instead rushed the draft law through the national assembly, where it currently holds all 125 seats.[2]

The State of Emergency Law infringes on the right to privacy and restricts the rights to freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, as enshrined in the Covenant.

The law contains many overly broad and vague provisions that violate fundamental rights without specifying why these measures are necessary and proportionate to address a public health emergency.

Under article 5 of the law, the government can:

Conduct unlimited surveillance of telecommunications (art. 5(10));

Control media and social media (art. 5(10) and (11));

Put in place “other measures that are deemed appropriate for and necessary to responding to the state of emergency” (art. 5(12)) – a catch-all provision providing unfettered powers.

Article 5 also gives the government complete authority to restrict freedom of movement and assembly.

Articles 1 and 4 of the State of Emergency Law allows the law to be used even after the end of the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, with reference to very vaguely formulated purposes and requirements. Article 3 also makes it clear that a state of emergency can be declared for a specific or unlimited period of time, without specifying the basis for making decisions about the length. Finally, the State of Emergency Law creates a permanent opportunity for the government to declare martial law (art. 5).

Notably, the law fails to provide any oversight for the use of these sweeping executive powers. On April 1, 2020, a Council of Ministers statement said that a state of emergency would not be declared for longer than three months – but added that the government would have discretion to extend it as it deems appropriate.[3]

This broad and vaguely formulated law could be easily misused against individuals and organizations critical of the government. The law includes disproportionate fines and prison sentences for vague criminal offenses. Article 7 creates the “crime of obstructing operations during a state of emergency,” punishable by one to five years in prison or five to ten years if the obstruction “leads to public unrest or adversely affects national security.” Article 8 creates the “crime of not respecting measures” required by the government, with punishments of up to five years in prison if the act “leads to public unrest.” These provisions can easily be used against critics of the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis, or any other situation in which a state of emergency is declared.

Article 9 creates a serious risk for civil society organizations or independent media outlets by providing for criminal responsibility for violations of the law by legal entities. The Cambodian government has long targeted independent media as well as organizations that promote human rights and democracy. Fines provided by the law of up to US$250,000 would bankrupt most Cambodian organizations.

Since the law’s adoption in 2020, the Cambodian government has not invoked it. The Covenant requires that measures adopted in times of public emergency that threaten the life of the nation are only those “strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.” The Human Rights Committee clarified that states parties are required to “provide careful justification not only for their decision to proclaim a state of emergency but also for any specific measures based on such a proclamation,”[4] stressing that such measures “are of an exceptional and temporary nature and may only last as long as the life of the nation concerned is threatened.” The law’s vague language and the overall human rights context in Cambodia indicate there are real risks of arbitrary pronouncements of states of emergency, for prolonged states of emergency or for any other misapplications of the law by the Cambodian government in violation of the Covenant.

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Repeal the Law on the Management of the Nation in a State of Emergency, which violates a number of civil and political rights, lacks independent oversight and procedural safeguards, as enshrined in the Covenant, or significantly amend it to address public health crises while protecting basic human rights. Any amendments to the law should be subject to open consultations of a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society groups.

The Human Rights Committee should pose the following questions to the government of Cambodia:

How will the Cambodian government ensure that the freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association as well as the right to privacy as enshrined in the Covenant be protected to the fullest extent possible during a state of emergency?

How will the Cambodian government guarantee that a state of emergency will be limited to a period that is absolutely necessary?

Right to life (articles 6 and 24)

The Cambodian government has a history of extrajudicial killings of political opponents, human rights defenders, journalists, and other critics of the government, and these killings have been met with impunity that symbolizes a continuing failure to protect the right to life.[5]

The extrajudicial killing of prominent political commentator and human rights defender Kem Ley sent shockwaves through the country and illustrated the culture of impunity of those responsible for such heinous crimes. On July 10, 2016, against a backdrop of harassment of civil society and the political opposition, Kem Ley was shot in a café in broad daylight at a petrol station in central Phnom Penh. This killing came days after Kem Ley had discussed a Global Witness report, “Hostile Takeover,”[6] that detailed the business links of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen’s family.[7]

Five and a half years after the brutal killing, the Cambodian authorities have still not conducted an effective and impartial investigation into the murder.[8] Instead, the authorities arrested Oeuth Ang, who identified himself as “Chuob Samlab” (meaning “Meet to Kill” in Khmer), who “confessed” to the killing.[9] Following a half-day trial on March 23, 2017, which was widely criticized for failure to meet international fair trial standards, the Phnom Penh court found Oeuth Ang guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.[10] On May 24, 2019, the Supreme Court upheld his sentence.

International and domestic human rights organizations have repeatedly called on the Cambodian government to set up an independent commission of inquiry[11] to conduct a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation into this killing, with emphasis on examining the potential criminal responsibility of persons other than the direct perpetrator, in line with international standards set out in the Covenant. [12] The Cambodian government has not taken any steps towards the establishment of such an independent and impartial investigative body.

Demonstrating the government’s unwillingness to hold those accountable for the grave crime and instead protecting the persons who planned and ordered Kem Ley’s killing, the Cambodian authorities have continually monitored, harassed, and ultimately disrupted and prohibited planned annual anniversary memorials since Kem Ley’s death, in violation of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as enshrined in the Covenant.

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Upon seeking and accepting technical assistance from states and international organizations, establish an independent commission of inquiry to conduct a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation into the killing of Kem Ley, to examine the criminal responsibility of persons other than the direct perpetrator, in line with the Covenant.

Prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and treatment of persons deprived of their liberty (articles 6, 7, 9 and 10)

Cambodia’s prisons and detention centers are notoriously overcrowded. Prisoners face poor conditions, and torture and other ill-treatment. There is a lack of transparency on deaths in custody. The Cambodian government has failed to implement the Human Rights Committee’s previous recommendations to improve conditions within the prison system, including lack of access to food, clean water and medical care. While the Ministry of Justice lauded its campaign to reduce prison overcrowding in 2020,[13] prisons remained seriously overcapacity throughout the pandemic.[14] Despite the government’s claims, incarceration rates continued to keep pace with the number of prisoners released, resulting in continued severe overcrowding. Infamously overcrowded prisons like Phnom Penh’s Correctional Center 1 were at an occupancy rate of 363 percent over capacity mid-2021, housing approximately 7,466 prisoners in a facility with an official capacity of 2,050.[15] In May 2021, Cambodian prison authorities revealed rising case numbers of prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19, and were incarcerated in some of Cambodia’s most overcrowded prisons. [16] However, the government’s response was slow or entirely absent in light of the pressing need to protect at-risk prisoners by, for instance, ordering early, temporary or conditional releases.[17]

Due to restricted prison access and a lack of transparency regarding prison data, exact numbers of deaths in detention remain unclear, and investigations into known deaths in custody have systematically lacked independence, transparency or access by independent monitors from civil society. However, civil society organizations have still learned about a number of deaths in detention and police custody that violate Cambodia’s obligations under the Covenant.

On April 18, 2019, Tith Rorn, an opposition activist and son of a former opposition politician in Kampong Cham province, died in police custody. Visible bruises on his body suggest he was severely beaten.[18] Police had arrested him on April 15, 2019, related to a 13-year-old assault charge even though the statute of limitations for the offense had expired. The Cambodian authorities claimed Tith Rorn fell in the jail’s bathroom. Family members refuted these allegations.[19] The authorities failed to conduct an independent or impartial investigation into the death. His family dismissed as false and dubious the edited video footage released by The Phnom Penh Post[20] that the newspaper stated came from Kampong Cham provincial police headquarters and supported allegations that the death was an accident.

On December 28, 2019, more than 30 Banteay Meanchey gendarmerie police arrested land rights activist, Tuoy Sros, and four other activists, at a land protest in front of the Banteay Meanchey provincial hall.[21] The authorities held the five men in a cell at the Banteay Meanchey headquarters of the gendarmerie. Upon arrest and thereafter in detention, the provincial gendarmerie officers allegedly beat and kicked the five men, inflicting serious injuries. On December 31, 2019, the prosecutor of the Banteay Meanchey provincial court charged all five men with intentional acts of violence on private property (articles 248 and 253 of Cambodia’s 2001 Land Law), and sent them to pre-trial detention at Banteay Meanchey provincial prison.

On January 1, 2020, due to Sros’ deteriorating medical condition, authorities transported him from the jail to the Japan-Cambodia Friendship Hospital in Banteay Meanchey province. On the way to the hospital, Sros died. On that same day, the authorities claimed that Sros had suffered from alcoholism withdrawal, while also denying that they had inflicted any ill-treatment on the detainee, despite physical evidence to the contrary.[22] Sros’ wife denied that her husband was an alcoholic or had any health issues. When she last visited her husband in prison on December 31, she noticed he was very weak and barely conscious due to the injuries he had suffered.[23] An Ruon, one of the other detained protesters, said that Sros had been handcuffed and kicked in the ribs “until he screamed for mercy.” [24] He said that Sros had “screamed all through the night, and they [the police] finally took him to another place, but they [the police] kept beating him until he lost his memory.” [25] Radio Free Asia had reported that authorities donated 10 million Cambodian riels (US$2,500) to Sros’ wife for funeral expenses and financial support for her children’s school fees.[26]

The three other protesters, Nov Noeun, Him Kiri and An Ruon, also sought medical examinations at the Japan-Cambodia Friendship Hospital for the ailments they suffered due to ill-treatment while in custody. They filed a complaint against the Banteay Meanchey military police about ill-treatment. According to An Ruon, “Sar Bunsoeung hit the victim [Sros] and pointed a pistol at his temple, threatening to kill him, saying, ‘I took 11 bodies out of this place, do you want to be the 12th?’”[27] Public outcries around the events led Prime Minister Hun Sen to call for the arrest of those responsible for the ill-treatment of the activists and Sros’ death. On January 18, 2020, the authorities arrested two military police officials, Col. Sar Bunsoeung, and First Lt. Chhoy Rathana, an officer working with the provincial anti-drug office, based on charges of “intentional violence and aggravating circumstances” (articles 218 and 224 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) after they confessed to being “negligent in their duty.”[28] On January 13, 2021, the Battambang court convicted Sar Bunsoeung and Chhoy Rathana and sentenced them to four years and seven years in prison, respectively, and fined them 140 million riels (US$34,500) in compensation to the complainants. Upon appeal of the verdict by the complainants, on May 26, 2021, the Battambang appeals court upheld the verdict against Chhoy Rathana, but reduced the prison sentence to be served by Sar Bunsoeung to one year and six months jail time, with the rest of the sentence suspended.

On October 30, 2019, Sam Bopha, a vocal opposition activist in Svay Rieng province and the daughter of a former opposition politician, died in police custody. While under arrest and being transported to the police station, she fell from a police officer’s motorbike.[29] More than a dozen police officers had previously arrived at her house to arrest her without a warrant. Despite Bopha telling the police officers arresting her that she was not feeling well, and family members proposing to drive her instead with their car to the police station, the arresting officers refused and put her on a police motorcycle.[30] A video posted on Facebook, which has since been removed, showed her unconscious after she fell off the moving motorbike.[31] Authorities claimed they investigated the incident, but there has been no progress and no one has been held accountable for her death.

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Take urgent measures, consistent with the Covenant, to reduce overcrowding at all of Cambodia’s detention centers and prisons by, among others, introducing alternatives to detention, including non-custodial sentences for non-violent crimes, and releasing persons in vulnerable groups of prisoners, such as pregnant women and children.

Improve poor conditions within the prison system, including lack of access to nutritious food, clean water and adequate medical care.

Systematically conduct thorough, independent and impartial investigations into the deaths and injuries of persons in the authorities’ custody: Investigate effectively the deaths of Tith Rorn, Sam Bopha and Tuoy Sros as well as the allegations of ill-treatment of Nov Noeun, Him Kiri and An Ruon, and hold the perpetrators to account.



Deprivation of liberty (articles 9, 10 and 14)

Since 2015, the government has stepped up its crackdown on opposition politicians, members of civil society and independent journalists, which has resulted in hundreds of criminal prosecutions on vague, unsubstantiated, and fabricated charges. The immediate result has been an unprecedented increase in the numbers of political prisoners.[32] Prosecutors, magistrates and judges, controlled by the ruling party, have authorized pre-trial detention for these individuals. By mid-November 2019, the number of political prisoners in pre-trial detention or serving prison sentences reached around 90; though this figure slightly dropped ahead of Cambodia’s chairmanship of the 13th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit taking place on November 25 and 26, 2021, when 26 activists were released after having spent months in prison.[33]

In Cambodia, persons held in pre-trial detention, including pregnant women and children, are detained together with convicted detainees.[34] Human Rights Watch documented numerous cases in which the Cambodian authorities violated due process rights by arresting people without arrest warrants, failed to inform persons arrested of the charges against them, or refused to grant them immediate access to their lawyers.[35]

In the absence of accessible and adequate mental health services in Cambodia, people with real or perceived psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions) can be arbitrarily detained and chained in drug detention centers or prisons in Cambodia,[36] often after being detained as part of sporadic crackdowns to “clean the streets” ahead of high-profile international meetings or visits by foreign dignitaries.[37] In June 2020, the Ministry of Interior proposed a draft Public Order Law, which could further entrench discrimination against at-risk groups in society such as people with psychosocial disabilities. The bill would provide the authorities with unfettered powers to arbitrarily strip people with mental health conditions of their civil liberties.[38] For example, draft article 25 states that a “caregiver or a guardian of a person with a mental disorder shall not allow that person to walk freely in public places.” In a country where people with psychosocial disabilities are stigmatized and subjected to abuse, such broad discretion given to authorities to restrict the liberties of a person with mental health conditions could facilitate further abuse and entrenchment of the problem.

The Cambodian authorities have resorted to prolonged pre-trial detention of some detainees awaiting trial, especially in cases involving political opponents.[39] This practice was exemplified by the so-called “ADHOC 5” case. On April 28, 2016, the Anti-Corruption Unit arrested five former and current senior staff members of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC), based on fabricated allegations that they had committed “bribery of a witness.”[40] The charges focused on their human rights and legal protection work in a case that was tied to ongoing persecution against opposition leader Kem Sokha.[41] On June 29, 2017, the authorities released all five human rights defenders on bail, with their charges still pending, after they had all spent 427 days in pre-trial detention.[42] On September 26, 2018, the Phnom Penh court convicted them and sentenced them to five-year suspended sentences.[43]

In other cases involving critics of the government, activists faced multiple dormant and new charges at the same time. On August 20, 2018, Cambodia’s king pardoned longtime land rights activist Tep Vanny after two years in prison for publicly protesting in a land dispute involving a company granted a concession in Phnom Penh’s Boeung Kak Lake community.[44] The authorities arrested Tep Vanny on August 15, 2016, during a peaceful protest that called for the release of the “ADHOC 5.” On August 22, 2016, the court convicted her of “insulting a public official,” and sentenced her to six days in prison. Instead of releasing her based on time served, the authorities reactivated dormant charges dating back to a 2013 peaceful protest, later sentencing her to two and half years of imprisonment and a fine of 14 million riels (US$3,500).[45] Subsequent to her royal pardon, a court convicted her of making death threats in what started out as an internal community dispute in 2012. While the complainant had dropped her lawsuit, the prosecutor decided to pursue it on his own accord, leading to Tep Vanny and five other Boeung Kak Lake community members being sentenced to six months’ imprisonment; the judge suspended the sentence for five years.[46]

The authorities also arbitrarily detained children and people with disabilities, and failed or refused to conduct medical assessments of the accused before the case went to trial. On June 24, 2021, around 30 police officers arrested Kak Sovann Chhay, a 16-year-old boy with autism and a son of a detained member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).[47] The officers did not have an arrest warrant, and did not explain the reasons for his arrest. An hour before his arrest, an unidentified person contacted him on the mobile Telegram app, asking Sovann Chhay who he was, calling his father “a traitor” and telling Sovann Chhay that he will be jailed too.[48] On June 25, 2021, the Phnom Penh municipal court imposed trumped-up charges of “incitement to commit a felony” and “public insult” (articles 494, 495 and 502 of Cambodia’s penal code) and ordered his pre-trial detention.[49] In their handling of the case, the authorities did not take into account that Sovann Chhay is a person with a disability and that he is a child under age 18. At trial, Sovann Chhay’s defense lawyer twice requested that Sovann Chhay's disability and support needs be evaluated. However, the court refused both requests. The prosecution argued that Sovann Chhay no longer had a disability. Human Rights Watch received reports that no reasonable accommodations were made for Sovann Chhay, either during police custody and questioning, or while he was in prison. On November 1, 2021, the court convicted him and sentenced him to eight months in prison. Sovann Chhay’s sentence was partially suspended, but he still had spent four and half months in prison in pre-trial detention.[50]

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

End its systematic use of pre-trial detention as a default action, and render such detention as a last resort to only be used in cases where absolutely necessary.

Promote alternative measures to detention in line with international human rights law. In cases of children, resort should always be made to alternatives to detention, such as non-custodial measures. Where children are detained, they should be detained only as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period. Equally, convictions of children should focus on reintegration and rehabilitation.

Ban chaining of people with psychosocial disabilities in law and in policy.

Ensure that due process rights of the accused are respected, including access to a lawyer, interpreter, and medical assessments, as well as access to reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities.

Stop harassment, arbitrary arrest and politically motivated prosecutions of human rights defenders, opposition politicians, and journalists.

Discard the draft Public Order Law, which seeks to control people’s daily lives by prohibiting a vast array of public and private actions, while discriminating against vulnerable groups in society such as persons with disabilities by allowing arbitrary restrictions on their freedom of movement.

Freedom of expression (article 19)

Since 2015, the Cambodian government has adopted an array of repressive laws or amended existing legislation to restrict the right to freedom of expression – online and offline – while also seeking to stifle independent media. These new laws complement preexisting laws that authorities have long used to silence activists and independent voices, such as criminal defamation and “incitement” in the penal code, which, as the Human Rights Committee has reiterated, violate Cambodia’s obligations under the Covenant.[51]

Stifling Media Freedom

The government has drastically curtailed media freedom, online and offline, leading to the shuttering of independent news outlets, arbitrary revocations of media licenses, and harassment of journalists.

Ahead of the 2018 elections, the government ramped up its efforts to shut down independent media outlets. In August 2017, Cambodian authorities ordered the closure of 32 FM radio frequencies, primarily targeting stations relaying Khmer-language news content produced by Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Voice of America.[52] The local Voice of Democracy radio was also forced to go off the air. In September 2017, The Cambodia Daily, one of the country’s few independent newspapers, was forced to close down after being handed a dubious tax bill of US$6.3 million.[53] In September 2017, RFA closed its operations in Cambodia, citing systematic harassment by the government. In May 2018, the government coerced the sale of the last independent local newspaper, the Phnom Penh Post, to a Malaysian businessman with reported ties to the Cambodian government by hitting the newspaper with a questionable tax bill of US$3.9 million.[54]

Cambodian authorities also targeted individual journalists based on their independent reporting on social and political issues. On November 14, 2017, authorities arbitrarily detained two RFA journalists, Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin, on fabricated charges of “espionage” for simply having continued to report for RFA after the closure of RFA’s Cambodia office.[55] While the authorities released the two reporters on bail after nine months in pre-trial detention, the charges against them were not dropped. In October 2020, the Supreme Court allowed for continued investigations into the case, instead of dismissing it based on lack of credible evidence against them.[56] The government’s tactic to leave dormant charges hanging over news reporters’ heads creates fear and self-censorship.

The Cambodian government used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to further stifle independent media by labelling independent reporting as “fake news,”[57] by, among others, imposing de facto bans on independent reporting,[58] and harassing dozens of journalists based on their reporting.[59] Exemplifying the government’s legal action against persons deemed to spread so-called “fake news” is the case against journalist Sovann Rithy,[60] director of the online news outlet TVFB, who a Phnom Penh municipal court convicted of incitement on October 5, 2020, and sentenced to 18 months in prison.[61] After deducting the five months and 28 days he had spent in pre-trial detention, the court suspended the remainder of the prison sentence and released him on the same day. Phnom Penh police originally arrested Sovann Rithy on April 7, 2020, based on allegations that he had incited chaos by quoting on his Facebook page the following words from Prime Minister Hun Sen’s speech of the same day about the economic impact of Covid-19: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.”[62]

In the first six months of 2020, the government revoked the following licenses of independent media outlets: online news site CKV TV Online; TVFB news site; and Rithysen radio station and online news site. The license of Cheat Khmer newspaper was under review after the politically motivated arrest of its owner, Ros Sokhet in June 2020.[63] Based on critical Facebook posts about Prime Minister Hun Sen, in November 2020, the Phnom Penh court convicted Sokhet of incitement and sentenced him to 18 months in prison.[64]

The Cambodian government also went to great lengths even to silence media workers who fled abroad out of fear of prosecution because of their work. In December 2018, upon the Cambodian government’s request, Thai authorities arrested and forcibly returned Rath Rott Mony, a “fixer” for the Russian state media outlet Russia Today (RT), to Cambodia based on allegations that he had committed “incitement to discriminate” (article 496 of Cambodia’s penal code). He had worked with RT on a documentary “My Mother Sold Me,” that featured accounts of poverty-stricken families sending their daughters to engage in child sex trafficking.[65] In June 2019, a court convicted Mony and sentenced him to two years in prison. Following the completion of his sentence, Mony again fled Cambodia, fearing further persecution.

Freedom of Speech Online

Since 2015 and increasingly during the pandemic, free speech online, particularly commentary critical of the government or its leaders that is expressed on social media platforms, has come under attack from increased government digital surveillance and interference, and often resulted in arrests. The tightening of free expression online has been enabled by laws adopted by the government that seek to monitor and control information and communication technologies while imposing censorship on criticism of the government.

In December 2015, the government adopted the Telecommunications Law,[66] which permits undeclared monitoring of “any private speech via telecommunications” by the authorities, without any procedural safeguards and judicial oversight. The law established an enforcement body of “telecommunications inspection officials” to investigate alleged offenses under the Telecommunications Law, with the authority to call in support from the armed forces “to join in cracking down on alleged crimes.”

This law was followed by the Inter-Ministerial Prakas (proclamation) on Website and Social Media Control, adopted on May 28, 2018, which allows the Ministries of Interior, Information, and Posts and Telecommunications[67] to take down content on social media outlets and websites that the government deems to be “incitement, breaking solidarity, discrimination and willfully creating turmoil leading to undermining national security, public interest and social order.” This overly broad regulation, which restricts the rights to freedom of expression, press and publication, empowers the government to police social media networks to uncover and silence online dissent in Cambodia.

In February 2021, the authorities enacted the Sub-Decree on the Establishment of the National Internet Gateway (NIG),[68] which is scheduled to come into effect in February 2022. The Sub-Decree requires internet service providers in Cambodia to re-route their services through the government controlled National Internet Gateway. The NIG will allow the government to further control the digital space and give the authorities broader powers to block and disconnect internet connections based on overbroad and undefined grounds. The NIG is likely to have a chilling effect on online communications and could generate self-censorship online among critical voices and independent media outlets already facing harassment, arbitrary administrative penalties or even arrest and prosecution based on their exercise of free speech. The NIG also risks internet shutdowns ordered by the government.

In addition, the government has also drafted a vaguely formulated cybercrime law,[69] which if passed could add to already existing threats to online speech and privacy rights. Article 45 criminalizes intentional false statements that have an “adverse effect” on national security and other undefined grounds. ”Unauthorized“ access to or transfer of data from computer systems is also criminalized, risking prosecutions of whistleblowers or investigative journalists who leaked materials. The draft law risks abuse by the government as it lacks any independent oversight or procedural safeguards against arbitrary application. All three leaked drafts of the bill have been sharply criticized by civil society groups, which have not been consulted by the government during the drafting process.[70]

As part of the government’s use of the Covid-19 pandemic to further restrict human rights, in February 2021 Human Rights Watch expressed concerns around the government’s so-called “Stop Covid-19” QR Code system,[71] which creates a log of people’s locations and thus information as to their identity, location, behavior, associations, and activities, ostensibly to trace the spread of Covid-19. The government failed to show that there were no measures available that were less intrusive to protect people from Covid-19. The government also failed to inform the public how the data collected through the QR Code system is used, who has access to the data and for what purpose, how data is secured, and the period for which the data is secured. This is particularly concerning in Cambodia, as the government has failed to adopt a data protection law or provide for overall safeguards to ensure official requests for data are necessary and proportionate. [72]

During the pandemic, the government has increased censorship online, attempting to muzzle critical opinions or fears about the pandemic expressed by the public on social media platforms. This is exemplified by a press release dated May 1, 2021,[73] in which the government demanded the immediate cessation of social media posts intended to “provoke and create chaos” in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, referring to such posts as “acts of attack,” which should be punished by legal action. The extent of the government’s campaign to silence all dissent online is shown by its actions in August 2021 when it sent senior officials to Bangkok to ask Thai authorities to block or otherwise stop the critical social media broadcasts of opposition activists residing in Thailand.[74]

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Cease harassment, arbitrary arrests, and physical assaults on human rights defenders and protesters based on their exercise of their right to freedom of expression; and investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of such attacks.

Repeal articles 305, 307, 502 and 523 of the Penal Code regarding defamation, public insult, or discrediting of judicial decision that violate freedom of expression.

Repeal the Sub-Decree on the Establishment of the National Internet Gateway, the Telecommunications Law, Inter-Ministerial Prakas (proclamation) on Website and Social Media Control, and discard the draft cybercrime bill.

Adopt a data protection law in line with international standards.

Cease arbitrary interference and surveillance of the online and offline media and use of repressive laws to censor and control the media.

Cease its silencing campaigning on social media by harassing persons based on their critical commentary posted online.

Cease intimidation, surveillance and harassment of journalists, while dropping all charges and immediately and unconditionally releasing all arbitrarily detained journalists.

Freedom of assembly (article 21)

Since 2015, the Cambodian authorities have also regularly taken measures to arbitrarily deny permission to hold peaceful, public demonstrations, and conducted intensive surveillance and interference of demonstrations that do take place, often using unnecessary or excessive force to disperse them. Sweeping arrests of protesters and arbitrary denials of protests by the authorities have now resulted in a de facto ban on demonstrations throughout Cambodia.[75]

The authorities systematically banned or disrupted peaceful protests, and arrested and prosecuted persons for exercising their right to peaceful assembly.

One example is the annual gatherings to commemorate slain prominent political commentator Kem Ley. In July 2019, authorities detained two youth activists, Kong Raiya and Soung Neakpoan, for peacefully participating in such a gathering.[76] The authorities charged both with “incitement to commit a felony.”[77] They arrested seven other people too and disrupted or canceled commemorations around the country.[78] After releasing Kong Raiya and Soung Neakpoan on bail in November 2019, with charges still pending, the Phnom Penh court convicted Neakpoan of “incitement to commit a felony” (articles 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code) on December 4, 2019 and sentenced him to two years in prison, while convicting Raiya in absentia of “incitement to commit a felony” (articles 88, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code) on June 19, 2020, and sentencing him to two years in prison, with the remainder of his sentence suspended due to time served in pre-trial detention.[79] Raiya was previously sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment in 2015 on spurious incitement charges in relation to a Facebook post that criticized the government.[80]

Restrictions to peaceful assembly and arbitrary arrests of peaceful protesters around the commemorations of Kem Ley’s death also continued a year later. On July 8, 2020, police blocked a Buddhist ceremony held by a group of youth activists and monks at the petrol station where the murder had happened. The authorities detained one of the activists, wearing a t-shirt with Kem Ley’s face on it, and held him for questioning.[81] The authorities released him after he agreed to sign a “pledge” not to partake in such protest activities again – a common practice used by authorities to threaten activists, while also stifling their free expression and peaceful assembly.

The authorities have systematically misinterpreted Cambodia’s Law on Peaceful Demonstrations, adopted in 2009, to read that organizers must obtain the government’s “permission” for protests to occur.[82] However, the law merely requires organizers of peaceful protests to notify the authorities about protests.[83] In August 2020, youth activists organized peaceful protests at the government’s designated protest area, called “Freedom Park,” on the outskirts of Phnom Penh to call for the release of a detained union leader, Rong Chhun. The authorities rejected the planners’ notification of the planned protests and arrested over a dozen activists.[84] During the same period, regular protests on the streets of Phnom Penh by family members calling for the release of detained opposition activists were frequently met with excessive use of force by city district security forces and plainclothes police officers.[85] Video footage shows police officers pushing and dragging protesters in an attempt to disperse the protesters.[86] Between August and October 2020, the authorities detained and charged a dozen protesters based on baseless incitement allegations after they had called for the release of political prisoners and respect for human rights.[87]

The de facto ban on peaceful assembly and prosecutions of protesters also continued in 2021. In August 2021, a Phnom Penh court convicted nine activists and former opposition members of incitement for peacefully protesting near the Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh as part of a 2020 campaign to commemorate the Paris Peace Accords anniversary, and sentenced them to between 12 and 20 months in prison.[88]

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Train law enforcement officials in line with the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials to ensure that the use of force occurs only in exceptional circumstances and lawfully.

Stop bans of peaceful protests and arbitrary arrests of protesters in violation of the Covenant.

Freedom of association (article 22)

Since 2015, the Cambodian government has adopted two draconian laws that have severely restricted the right to freedom of association for civil society and independent unions in Cambodia.

Closing Civil Society Space

The Cambodian authorities adopted the Law on Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations (LANGO) in 2015. The LANGO empowers the authorities to shut down organizations or deny them registration based on vaguely, undefined, and broadly formulated concepts such as “political neutrality.” Officials have also imposed burdensome reporting requirements that smaller civil society groups are unable to meet.[89]

In July 2016, the government targeted the “Situation Room,” a consortium of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working on human rights protection and monitoring around the elections, based on groundless allegations that the consortium had violated the LANGO by failing to register. The authorities also claimed the “Situation Room” violated the vague and undefined concept of “political neutrality” in the LANGO, an offense that allows authorities to dissolve NGOs or deny them registration.[90] The government alleged without any credible evidence that the consortium had sought to topple the government.

On August 23, 2017, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the closure of the US-funded NGO National Democratic Institute (NDI), and the expulsion of its non-Cambodian staff, citing LANGO and the 1997 Tax Law.[91] Since LANGO’s adoption, human rights groups have experienced significant government restrictions. In October 2017, the government also suspended the land rights group Equitable Cambodia on groundless accusations, and prevented it from conducting its activities for a period going beyond the legally provided 15-day suspension period under the law. Local authorities routinely misread and misinterpret the LANGO, demanding that NGOs seek permission before conducting activities.[92] NGOs also often report that local authorities and police interfere with their meetings and training sessions, frequently seeking to shut down events, or sit in the back of rooms, taking photos and requesting attendance lists of meeting participants.

Harassment of Independent Trade Unions

The Law on Trade Unions adopted in 2016 severely curtailed the ability of unions to register, collectively bargain, and represent workers, thus excluding them from collective bargaining to protect their rights and improve working conditions.[93] The Trade Union Law has also undercut the work of the Arbitration Council – a dispute resolution body that both employers and unions viewed as working credibly and effectively – by restricting workers’ ability to raise collective disputes. In early 2020, the Cambodian government adopted 10 amendments to the Trade Union Law but these were adopted without an inclusive and genuine consultative process with trade unions, workers, or civil society and they failed to address all the serious shortcomings in the law that severely limit the freedom of association and workers’ rights to organize and collective bargaining.[94]

The Law on Trade Unions came at a time of increased harassment of independent trade union leaders and labor advocates, which saw dozens of union leaders subjected to persecution based on politically motivated cases. On the evening of July 31, 2020, the authorities arrested trade union leader Rong Chhun following his public comments on rural communities’ land loss because of the demarcation of the Cambodia-Vietnam border.[95] After a year in pre-trial detention, in August 2021, a court convicted him of incitement, together with two other activists, and sentenced him to two years in prison and a large fine of 400 million riel (US$100,000), which must be paid to the government’s Border Affairs Committee.[96] After more than 15 months in pre-trial detention, on November 12, 2021, the authorities released him with the remainder of his sentence suspended.

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Repeal the LANGO, which allows arbitrary monitoring, interference, and harassment of civil society organizations, violating the rights to freedom of expression and association.

Cease all monitoring and interference with the activities of NGOs.

Amend the Law on Trade Unions in consultation with workers, labor advocates and other stakeholders, to bring it into full compliance with International Labor Organization Conventions No. 87 (Freedom of Association) and No. 98 (Right to Organize and Collectively Bargain), both ratified by Cambodia.

Cease the harassment, arbitrary arrests, and physical attacks on trade unionists and workers, and investigate and appropriately prosecute the perpetrators of such attacks.

Restore the work of the Arbitration Council to hear all collective disputes of workers, irrespective of whether they are represented by a union.

Right to vote and take part in public life (article 25)

The Cambodian government seriously violated the right of Cambodians to vote by conducting an election that was neither free nor fair in 2018. The result was a National Assembly that consists entirely of 125 members of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP), solidifying effective single-party rule. In the lead-up to the 2018 national elections, the Cambodian authorities intensified its crackdown on the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The legal and judicial measures used by the Cambodian government resulted in many political opposition members threatened and forced to flee the country. The government spearheaded a politically motivated legal effort to dissolve the CNRP on fabricated grounds that the party had received foreign support to launch a “color revolution” to topple the Cambodian government, which later was endorsed by the CPP-controlled Supreme Court in November 2017.

On September 3, 2017, eight members of Prime Minister Hun Sen’s personal bodyguard unit and about 100 police officers arrested CNRP party leader Kem Sokha at his home in Phnom Penh.[97] An investigating judge charged him with “colluding with foreigners” under article 443 of the Cambodian criminal code, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. He was immediately stripped of his parliamentary immunity on the grounds that he was caught in the act of committing a crime, even though the purported evidence against him was a selectively edited video of a speech he gave in 2013.[98] A three-month-long trial was interrupted in March 2020 due to claimed reasons of Covid-19.[99] After continued postponement, in January 2021 the court informed Sokha that his case was no longer a “priority” because the authorities were pursuing new cases against hundreds of opposition members.[100] Sokha has spent over two years in arbitrary detention.

On June 5, 2018, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared Sokha’s pre-trial detention “arbitrary” and “politically motivated,” and said Cambodian authorities should immediately release him.[101] In the face of international pressure and concerns about his deteriorating health, Cambodian authorities released Sokha from the remote Tbong Khmum provincial Correctional Center III in September 2018 and placed him under de facto house arrest imposed through highly restrictive conditions of judicial supervision.[102] After two years of postponement of his trial, the trial resumed on January 19, 2022.

In 2017, the government passed two rounds of repressive amendments to Cambodia’s 1997 Law on Political Parties.[103] The amendments empower authorities to dissolve political parties and ban party leaders from political activity without holding hearings or an appeal process. The amendments also contain numerous restrictions that appear to have been tailored to use against the CNRP, most notably provisions that compel political parties to distance themselves from members who have been convicted of a criminal charge. On January 6, 2019, the government passed a third round of amendments to the Law on Political Parties, giving Prime Minister Hun Sen unfettered discretion to decide if banned politicians could regain their political rights.[104] Politicians seeking such a judgment would have to file a request to Prime Minister Hun Sen or the Minister of the Interior.

Based on the amendments to the Law on Political Parties, on November 16, 2017, the Supreme Court arbitrarily dissolved the CNRP, and imposed a five-year ban on political activities of 118 senior party members. Many opposition party members have since fled the country out of fear of being arrested.[105]

The co-leader of the CNRP, Sam Rainsy, who has been in exile since 2015 due to fear of arrest, faces years in prison based on numerous convictions on bogus, politically manufactured charges if he ever returned to Cambodia.

In the first six months of 2019, the authorities summoned 147 CNRP leaders and activists to court or police stations on spurious charges.[106] In August 2019, Sam Rainsy and other exiled CNRP leaders announced they would return to Cambodia on November 9, 2019. The Cambodian government reacted by cracking down with a wave of arrests of CNRP members and supporters between August and November, which saw at least 78 CNRP activists imprisoned based on groundless charges, such as “conspiracy” and “incitement.”[107] By mid-November 2019, Cambodia had jailed nearly 90 people on political grounds.[108] While most were later released on bail, charges were not dropped, risking rearrest at a later time. To prevent the return of the CNRP leadership, the government also adopted restrictive measures, including banning CNRP leaders from returning to Cambodia and coordinating travel restrictions with Thailand and other neighboring countries, which rendered it virtually impossible for them to return.[109]

In November 2020, the authorities summoned over 100 opposition figures in mass trials based on their political affiliation and against people engaged in peaceful activism and expression. As part of these mass trials, in March 2021, the authorities convicted nine exiled CNRP leaders, including Sam Rainsy, in absentia based on attempted “attack” charges, and sentenced them to up to 25 years in prison. The case against them is based on false allegations that the CNRP attempted to stage a coup by announcing their plans to return to Cambodia in November 2019.[110]

The Human Rights Committee should recommend that the Cambodian government:

Drop all charges against and immediately and unconditionally release all detained political opposition activists.

Cease the government’s campaign of harassment, arbitrary arrests, and physical attacks on political opposition members and supporters.

Repeal the amendments to the Law on Political Parties that permit the arbitrary dissolution of political parties and that ban party leaders from political activity without due process."
49,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/detained-02142022122739.html,Police detain two women in China Jiangsu for trying to help chained woman Radio Free Asia,14/02/2022,China,f4762fd1-5c95-38d7-9400-6afd03905ba9,"Authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu have detained two women who traveled to the home village of a woman found chained in an outbuilding, sparking a wave of public outrage online over rampant human trafficking.



Two women who traveled to Jiangsu's Feng county in a bid to help Yang ***xia after a video of her living conditions went viral are being held under criminal detention by police, according to an audio recording posted to social media platforms late on .



""She is suspected of committing a crime,"" a police officer at Sunlou police station is heard telling a person who inquires after one of the women. ""They will definitely be issuing a notice of criminal detention.""



The post containing the audio clip had been viewed more than six million times on one social media platform by noon on , local time.



Current affairs commentator Cai Shenkun said the local authorities appear to be trying to limit the damage done by the revelations about Yang, who was allowed to marry and have eight children -- in contravention of Chinese law and family planning regulations at the time -- despite having received a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the days after the video of her chained to a wall went viral.



Cai said a former People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier from Nanchong in the southwestern province of Sichuan has disputed the official claim that Yang is a suspected missing person from Yunnan province, claiming that she is his missing daughter Li Ying, while her uncle has demanded a DNA test to confirm her identity.



""The main question is whether Yang is Xiao Huamei or Li Ying, a girl who went missing in Sichuan,"" Cai said. ""Local officials are likely looking to make life easier for themselves.""



Amateur analysis done by social media users found strong similarities between photos of Li and photos of Yang.



Cai said the authorities likely don't want to test to see if Yang really is Li Ying for fear of sparking the ire of military veterans, who have besieged government buildings in recent years over unpaid benefits, pensions and medical bills since their demobilization, leaving many in economic hardship.



""The government is trying to improve the status of demobilized soldiers, and Li Ying's father served in Tibet for 12 years, so her disappearance could easily make veterans angry,"" he said.



Famed writer censored

Ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) censors are also deleting content about Yang and other Feng county trafficking cases, including the account of U.S.-based author and screenwriter Geling Yan after she wrote hit out at the treatment of Chinese women, spurred by anger at Yang's treatment, and after she agreed with a retired scholar who called CCP leader Xi Jinping a trafficker on his YouTube channel.



Yan's husband Lawrence Walker confirmed she had said the words ""Xi Jinping is a trafficker,"" but said she didn't know her conversation with retired Renmin University professor Zhou Xiaozheng was being recorded, nor that her comments would be broadcast on YouTube.



""She said what she said and thinks what she thinks, but she would have preferred to choose the time, place and method to express herself, rather than being put into this position,"" Walker wrote.



In an essay on the topic, Yan described herself as ""angry, sad and restless"" after hearing about Yang's treatment. ""I realized that maybe it's time to set aside time for anger, just to let it happen.""



""Anger makes poets, and anger fuels a lot of my fiction, so anger qualifies as my theme these days,"" she wrote. ""I called the past five days my festival of rage.""



In the essay, Yan also takes aim at Yang's eldest son, who is reportedly suing the person who made the initial video of his mother.



""How can people's concept of family relations and morality be so upside and confused to such an absurd degree?"" Yan wrote. ""She is your biological mother, child!""



""Our civilization has evolved to the point where we don't even tie a dog up with an iron chain,"" she wrote. ""Not only did this eldest child ... not rescue his mother, but he sued the person calling for her to be rescued.""



""Your mother is basically a slave, a sex slave ... you were grown in her reluctant womb, came into the world through her torn birth canal, and you owe your existence to her torture ... and you still try to ... prevent her from breaking free from this prison,"" the essay said, addressing all eight of Yang's children.



Keyword searches for Yan's name returned no results on social media platforms on .



A social media user surnamed Wang, said Feng county has long been notorious as a center for trafficking in women and girls, and a video she tried to repost on the topic was recently blocked.



""The moment I had posted that video they blocked it, so I couldn't pass on content related to the chained woman,"" Wang said.



Scholar Wang Zheng said a number of accounts of WeChat have also been shut down for posting about Yang or Feng county.



""They are now deleting some of the information [about the story] and also shutting down some WeChat accounts,"" Wang Zheng said. ""This has become routine now for the authorities.""



""Posts about the two women who went to help the chained woman [and were detained] are also disappearing,"" he said. ""They don't want people to help each other.""

Guo had not been heard from since 5th December 2021, after he sent out a message to his close friends stating that he would be taken into custody.





Guo Feixiong, 55, has previously been imprisoned from 2006 to 2011 for alleged ‘illegal business activity’ following the publication a book titled Shenyang Political Earthquake, in which he investigated government corruption in the Liaoning province, and from 2013 to 2019 for ‘gathering crowds to disturb social order’ after he gave a speech in support of press freedom at a local newspaper’s anti-censorship protest. While in prison, Guo was subjected to torture including electric shocks.





“By arresting Guo Feixiong again, after already detaining him for 11 years in the past, the Chinese regime shows its determination to silence one of the most vocal defenders of press freedom in China at all costs”, says the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who urges the international community to build up pressure on Beijing to “secure Guo’s release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.”





On 28th January 2021, Guo Feixiong tried to leave China for the United States to visit his wife Zhang Qing, who was terminally ill, but he was denied boarding. Zhang passed away early this month, before she could reunite with her husband.





RSF has recently published an unprecedented investigative report entitled ‘The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China’, which reveals the previously unheard-of campaign of repression led by Beijing against journalism and the right to information worldwide.





China, ranked 177th out of 180 in the 2021 RSF World Press Freedom Index, is the world's largest captor of journalists with at least 128 detained."
